Statement of the virtual cabinet meeting of Wednesday, 09 February 2022ISSUES IN THE ENVIRONMENState of the Nation Address (SoNA). Cabinet welcomed the 2022 SoNA delivered by President Cyril Ramaphosa to the Joint Sitting of the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces at the Cape Town City Hall on Thursday, 10 February 2022, which is a rallying point for the entire nation. The SoNA is an important event in the calendar of the democratic government as it affords the Head of the Executive the opportunity to reflect on the country’s socio-economic and political status, and to also present government’s plans for the year ahead and beyond to political representatives of the people and the nation at large. In the coming weeks respective Ministers will unpack government’s Programme of Action for 2022, which will be informed by the National Budget Speech to be tabled on Wednesday, 23 February 2022 as well as the budget votes of all government departments. Participation in Census 2022. Cabinet appealed to all citizens and people who live in the country to participate in Census 2022, which began on Thursday, 3 February 2022 and continues until Monday, 28 February 2022. This is the fourth post-democracy population count and the last one was conducted in 2011. The results of the Census play an essential role in the allocation of resources to meet the service-delivery and basic needs of our communities. South Africans can choose to participate in Census 2022 through telephone, digital computer-assisted counting or physical door-to-door visits. Digital computer-assisted counting is only applicable to those who registered on line before the 5th February. Update on the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Cabinet applauded South Africans for their continued determination in the fight against COVID-19, which helped keep new infections relatively low despite the menace of the fourth wave. COVID-19 remains a part of our lived experience, and all health and safety protocols must be followed at all times, including maintaining social distancing, washing and sanitising hands, and wearing a mask in public that covers both the mouth and nose. As the deadly virus continues to claim lives, vaccination remains our best defence. The more people vaccinate, the more safer we will be as a nation. As the country gradually returns to normality with the economy reopening and schools having resumed daily attendance and full-time learning, Cabinet called on all unvaccinated persons over the age of 12 to vaccinate as soon as possible. You only need to present yourself at any vaccination site, even without an appointment, to be registered and vaccinated for free. Cabinet also encouraged those who are fully vaccinated to go for a booster shot, which helps increase antibody levels to effectively neutralise COVID-19 variants. Booster shots are available to anyone who received their last and primary dose at least six months ago. By being up to date with vaccinations, we do not only reduce the risk of serious illness, hospitalisation and death, but we also reduce the risk of future deadly variants. Judicial Commission of Inquiry into State Capture Report Cabinet noted the recent handover of the first and second parts of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into State Capture Report to President Ramaphosa as an important milestone in the fight against corruption. Cabinet firmly supports the process that will see the President mapping out interventions to implement the commission’s recommendations when he submits the full report to Parliament by 30 June 2022. Investigation report on the July 2021 Civil Unrests Cabinet joined President Ramaphosa in welcoming the release of the report of the Expert Panel appointed to review government’s response to the spate of orchestrated public violence, destruction and sabotage in July 2021. The President tabled the report of the Expert Panel at a meeting of the National Security Council on Friday, 4 February 2022 and subsequently authorised that it be made public. The panel was chaired by Profssor Sandy Africa and included Advocate Mojanku Gumbi and Mr Silumko Sokupa as members, with Mr Michael Sarjoo serving as the secretary of the panel. The panel was mandated to examine all aspects of the security response to the unrests that took place mainly in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng and to make recommendations on how to strengthen security capabilities. The report and the insights it provides on the work of and challenges faced by security services, law-enforcement agencies and relevant organs of state will guide government’s response. Gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF). As part of the country’s fight against GBVF, President Ramaphosa recently signed into law three Acts that strengthen efforts to end GBVF – the Criminal and Related Matters Amendment Act, Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act and Domestic Violence Amendment Act. Cabinet believes the signing of the new laws is a major advance to defeat GBVF and calls on the South African Police Service and National Prosecuting Authority to leverage the new provisions to provide justice for those who lost loved ones, friends or colleagues to this scourge. Cabinet looks forward to the speedy enforcement of these laws to provide greater protection to victims of violence and abuse. Remember to report incidents of GBVF to your local police station, through the toll-free Crime Stop number: 086 00 1011.1 or 24-hour GBV Command Centre hotline: 0800 428 428.

In setting a new public health order for the continent, the summit endorsed South Africa’s concept to establish an African pandemic response fund and proposals on how the continent can cushion itself from any further health shocks. Cabinet also welcomed the election of South Africa into the AU Peace and Security Council (AUPSC). The AUPSC is the standing decision-making organ of the AU for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts. It is a collective security and early warning arrangement intended to facilitate timely and efficient responses to conflict and crisis situations in Africa. It is also the key pillar of the African Peace and Security Architecture, which is the framework for promoting peace, security and stability in Africa. The AUPSC comprises 15 members with equal voting powers.
