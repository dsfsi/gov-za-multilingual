A.      Issues in the environment1.  10 May – 29th Anniversary of the Inauguration of first democratically elected president1.1. This Cabinet meeting took place exactly 29 years to the day when President Nelson Mandela was inaugurated as the first President of a democratic South Africa on 10th May 1994.  After three and a half centuries of colonialism and separate development where one’s ability to have access to basic services  were on the basis of one’s skin colour, a democratic South Africa set inclusive development goals to achieve a prosperous, non-racial, non-sexist and equal society.1.2. While many gains have been made since 1994, much more still needs to be done to realise the country’s development goals.1.3. The South African Reserve Bank has released an upgraded series of banknotes and coins, which celebrate our constitutional democracy and pay tribute to our beloved Madiba.2.  Presidential Health Summit2.1.  The second Presidential Health Summit held on 4-5 May 2023  focussed on nine pillars of the 2019 Presidential Health Compact: human resources; access to medicine, vaccines and health products; infrastructure; private sector engagement; quality healthcare; public sector financial management improvements; governance and leadership; community engagements; information systems and pandemic preparedness.2.2.  One of the outcomes of the Summit was the renewed commitment to implement the National Health Insurance (NHI). This is part of a programme to reduce disparities in accessing health care services by alleviating the financial burden for accessing healthcare services.2.3.  Cabinet welcomes the adoption of measures that are needed to recalibrate the health system and accelerate the NHI reforms. These move our health systems closer to better serve South Africans.3.  Energy3.1.

Intense work is underway at Eskom to increase the Utility’s Energy Availability Factor through substantial maintenance, maximising the use of Open Cycle Gas Turbines, securing additional generation capacity from private investment in renewables and scaling up awareness to improve Demand Side Management from large electricity users and from households.3.3. Acts of sabotage continue to plague the Eskom’s infrastructure and therefore the continued deployment of 880 SANDF members to safeguard a number of Eskom power stations is part of measures to prevent attempts to collapse the national grid. 3.4. Cabinet welcomed the decision to appeal the recent Pretoria High Court ruling that instructed Eskom to exempt public institutions, including schools, clinics, hospitals, and police stations, from load shedding based on the implications of this judgement.3.5.  Cabinet wishes to remind South Africans to continue to save electricity towards the national target to save 1000MW.4. Infrastructure Development4.1.  South Africa’s infrastructure drive to revitalise the economy and create employment continues to gain momentum. In this regard, the Minister of Transport, Ms Sindi Chikunga broke ground for the Ashburton Interchange Project worth R2.4-billion in Msunduzi Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal, which will improve the seamless movement of cargo from the Port of Durban into the country and the SADC region.4.2.  Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure, Mr. Sihle Zikalala has handed over 13 small harbours refurbished through the R501 million government’s Small Harbours Repairs and Maintenance Programme.

Cabinet welcomed the start of pre-negotiation talks between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces, which commenced in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on 6 May 2023. A peaceful Sudan, led by a civilian government, is essential not only for Sudan but also for the broader region and the continent. Cabinet therefore calls on both parties to negotiate an agreement to end the conflict and alleviate the suffering of the Sudanese people.9.4.

A total of R41 billion of these exports are to other African countries indicating the strides South African industries are making in broadening their markets across the continent.10.3.  The markets where trade has increased include China, Belgium, Italy and the United Arab Emirates indicating  the direct benefits from South Africa’s economic diplomacy.B. Cabinet decisions 1.

Bills    1.

This is to effect the application of the Sections 88A (1) (b) and 91 of the Correctional Services Act, 1998 (Act 111 of 1998).1.3.
