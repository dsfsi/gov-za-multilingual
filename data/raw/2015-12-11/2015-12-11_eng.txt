1. Implementation of key government programmes1.1. Cabinet welcomed the signing of 26 agreements to the value of R94 billion during the recent State Visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping. The signed agreements included R12 billion to build a car-manufacturing plant in South Africa, a US$500 million loan facility to Eskom for infrastructure development and a US$2.5 billion funding guarantee for Transnet from the China Development Bank.  As part of the 2nd Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), President Xi Jinping pledged US$60 billion for development in Africa. The adoption of a new Declaration and Plan of Action (2016-2018) at FOCAC consolidates the growing mutual partnership between Africa and China, which will unlock new trade and investment opportunities to help stimulate economic growth.The economy further received an economic boost with South Africa’s BMW Group announcing an investment of R6 billion at its plant in Rosslyn, Pretoria, which bears testament to the important partnership that exists between business and government, and the role that business is playing in the development of the economy. 1.2. On Tuesday, 8 December, President Zuma bestowed National Orders to South African citizens and eminent foreign nationals who have contributed to the upliftment of humanity. The National Orders are a moment of great reflection, celebration and pride for our people. They celebrate human achievement, human sacrifice and human endeavours that make our country a better place. We salute the recipients of the 2015 National Orders. 1.3. Cabinet appeals to all South Africans to use water sparingly. This is in support of a number of measures taken to alleviate the water shortages, which have been exacerbated by the heatwave the country has experienced in the past weeks. Whilst the recent rainfalls in some parts of the country provided some relief, the country’s water shortage remains a real challenge and requires all of us to use water sparingly and responsibly. 1.4. Cabinet expressed its appreciation to all South Africans for participating in this year’s 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children campaign, which ended yesterday. Recent research indicates high numbers of new HIV infections, particularly among young women and girls in Africa between 15 and 24 years of age. South Africans are encouraged to take forward their activism into everyday action as part of the #365 Days Campaign of No Violence Against Women and Children and the #CountMeIn campaign that unfolds throughout the year ahead.Through the #365 Days Campaign and #CountMeIn, the country needs to continue mobilising members of society, especially men, to join hands with government in dealing with this scourge. It is the responsibility of the nation, both individually and collectively, to stop the spread of the virus by taking care of our own health and that of others. 1.5. Cabinet has appreciated the progress that has been made by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in developing a bio-manufacturing process for HIV antibodies. This brings the health industry a step closer to an economically viable preventative treatment. Whilst the country still struggles to find the cure for HIV and AIDS, South Africans are still expected to practice safe sex and observe the ABC (Abstain, Be faithful and Condomise) principles of preventing new infections. 1.6. Cabinet commends all learners, students, teachers, lecturers, schools and institutions of higher learning on concluding a successful academic year, despite the challenges experienced during the year. Cabinet also wishes those who agreed to postpone examinations rescheduled for 2016 well in their coming examinations.   1.7. The Department of Social Development, in collaboration with Department of Defense and National Youth Development Agency, will hold its 6th National Youth Camp. This is a youth leadership development programme that seeks to change behaviour, attitudes and empower the youth about opportunities at their disposal.  The camp also assists with mentoring and teaching young boys to grow into men who value and respect women. 1.8. A joint agreement signed between the Minister of Higher Education and Training Minister, Dr Blade Nzimande, and BRICS partners – Brazil, Russia, India and China – is aimed at developing a framework for future cooperation in education. The agreement covers general education, educational policy strategy, Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges and higher education. TVET colleges hold the potential to unlock economic opportunities for our young people, while addressing the challenges of unemployment, inequality and poverty affecting communities.                    The agreement, which will improve the quality of teaching and teachers’ education, also commits BRICS universities to support joint research projects, encourage collaborative programmes at postgraduate, doctoral and postdoctoral levels and the co-publishing of scientific results.1.9. The Department of Science and Technology hosted the Science Forum South Africa under the theme “Igniting conversations about science”. Over 45 countries participated in debates on the interface between science, technology and innovation and society, specifically in the context of development. The forum also served to strengthen South Africa’s strategic international science, technology and innovation partnerships. 1.10. South Africa will be represented in the Council of International Maritime Organisation. This is a major step towards realising the country and the continent’s potential in the maritime sector. The organisation is responsible for adopting decisions on global maritime affairs, ranging from the Oceans Economy, rescue initiatives and safety and security matters at sea. The participation in this body will support government’s programme of unlocking the country’s maritime potential through the Blue Oceans Economy Strategy and Operation Phakisa, which aims to create over one million jobs by 2033. ‎1.11. The South African National Defence Force commenced in the past week a process to upgrade Salisbury Island Naval Station in Durban into a fully functional naval base. The upgrading of facilities will improve defence capabilities and also contribute towards the ocean economy. 1.12. The Department of Health, in partnership with Soul City and Times Media, launched a dedicated health and lifestyle channel The Good Life Network on DStv channel 199. The channel offers diverse, entertaining and original home-grown content on nutrition, health and fitness, human rights, youth sexuality, HIV and TB, as well as consumer and gender rights. Cabinet calls on South Africans to watch the channel. 2. Key Cabinet decisions2.1. Cabinet approved the publication of the White Paper on the National Health Insurance (NHI) for South Africa, for public comment. The NHI is part of government’s major health sector reforms. The policy proposes government’s ability to offer medical services to all who visit its health facilities. It will be funded through a central fund that will also be made available to private medical practitioners who want to participate in the scheme. Once finalised, the policy will be phased in over the years and focus mainly on commencing in underserviced areas. The Minister of Health, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, will today brief the media on the roll-out of the NHI. 2.2. Cabinet approved the National Integrated Early Childhood Development (ECD) Policy. The policy was developed in consultation with various stakeholders in the sector. It went through public consultation in February 2015.

Cabinet approved for the submission to Parliament of South Africa’s 5th Periodic Report (2009-2014) on the Implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Cabinet approved the publication of the Draft National Action Plan to Combat Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, for public comment. The plan is an integrated and systematic national strategy aimed at combating racism and building a truly non-racist and non-sexist democratic South Africa.It provides a framework for sustained and coordinated measures to be undertaken by the country as a whole to deal with the legacy of racism and racial discrimination. This assists South Africa to meet its international, regional and national obligations, specifically the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the UN at the World Conference against Racism in 2001. 2.7. Cabinet was briefed on progress made on the digital migration programme. It approved the commencement of the dual-illumination period for the digital broadcasting signal in South Africa on 1 February 2016. The migration from analogue to digital broadcasting services releases the much-needed radio frequency spectrum suitable for the provision of mobile broadband services. This will increase the competitiveness of the South African economy by revitalising the broadcasting industry, strengthening the electronics manufacturing industry, creating jobs, and developing more local and diverse broadcast content. 2.8. Cabinet was briefed on the findings of the 2014 South African Science, Technology and Innovation Indicators Report and the trends in the performance of the National System of Innovation (NSI), produced annually by the National Advisory Council on Innovation.

Cabinet approved the rationalisation of magisterial districts for Limpopo and Mpumalanga, and the designation of the Lephalale Magistrate’s Court as a local seat of the Limpopo Division of the High Court, as an interim measure until a separate permanent local seat of the Division is built in the area.The rationalisation of magisterial districts and areas of jurisdiction of the Divisions of the High Court is part of the policy reform aimed at redressing the legacy of spatial injustices of the past. It is also part of the broader transformation imperative to enhance access to justice, which is aligned to the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996. 2.10. Cabinet approved the report on progress regarding the implementation of the Cabinet directives in Limpopo in terms of Section 100 (1) (a) of the Constitution.

The summit focused on strengthening local government across the African continent, particularly financial management and establishing a secure revenue base, towards the attainment of Agenda 2063 – the Africa we want.The summit supports the goals of the NDP in which cities and local government play an important role in our overall development. 5.2. Cabinet remains confident that as negotiations unfold at the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), a fair and binding agreement will be reached.Climate change is a global problem requiring a global solution, which can only be effectively addressed multilaterally, under the broad-based legitimacy of the UNFCCC and with all parties making a contribution. In South Africa, we can proudly say that we have put in place progressive, innovative and proactive policies, and plans to deal with an ever-changing climate. These policies are guided by the overarching principle of sustainable development, which is the cornerstone of Vision 2030 as contained in the NDP. 5.3.
