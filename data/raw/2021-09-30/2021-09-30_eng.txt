A.    Issues in the environment1.    Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) vaccine roll-out 1.1.    Cabinet is encouraged by the millions of people in South Africa who have chosen to vaccinate against COVID-19, with over 17 million vaccine doses administered to date. 1.2.    Cabinet thanked the religious formations, as well as the sports and arts fraternity, for embarking on vaccination campaigns to encourage the uptake of vaccines.  1.3.    The more people get vaccinated, the sooner the country will relax the current Adjusted Alert Level 2 restrictions. This will inevitably result in the full opening of the economy to be able to grow and create much-needed jobs.  1.4.    Cabinet reiterates the call that to   reduce new infections, we all have to continue  wearing a mask in public, washing hands with soap and water or using a 70% alcohol-based sanitiser, and maintaining a safe social distance continues to reinforce the country’s approach in reducing new infections.2.    Vooma Vaccination Weekend campaign from 1 to 2 October 20212.1.    Cabinet urges unvaccinated South Africans and people living in South Africa to take advantage of the Vooma Vaccination Weekend which will take place around the country on Friday, 1 and Saturday, 2 October 2021.2.2.    The Vooma Vaccination Campaign Weekend is an inclusive national campaign supported by all social partners, including faith-based formations, traditional leaders, organised labour and business. The target for this weekend is to vaccinate at least half a million people.2.3.    This is an opportunity for all adults to be vaccinated free of charge and without appointments at public, private and pop-up vaccination sites.2.4.    You don’t need to have health insurance or medical aid to receive the vaccine. Leadership of government, business, labour and community formations will actively mobilise communities in all parts of the country to roll up their sleeves for the protection that comes with being vaccinated.  2.5.    Vooma Vaccination Weekend can help us achieve victory over the virus that has haunted us for more than a year. No-one should miss out on this opportunity. Let’s all Stay Safe.3.    Presidential Visit to Msikaba Bridge3.1.

Apart from facilitating the convenient movement of people by connecting rural communities to urban centres around the country, the bridge will also stimulate investment and growth. 3.2.    The N2 Wild Coast road network is one of government’s key Strategic Integrated Projects to catalyse economic growth at a national, provincial and local level.
