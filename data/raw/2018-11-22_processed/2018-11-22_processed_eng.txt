Cabinet met on Wednesday, 21 November 2018 at Tuynhuys in Cape Town. Issues in the Environment. Investment. Cabinet welcomes the successful inaugural Africa Investment Forum held from 7 to 9 November 2018 at the Sandton Convention Centre in Gauteng. African governments and businesses, international financial institutions and other development partners focused on making Africa the next global frontier in investment. At the close of the conference 45 deals, worth US$32 billion, were concluded to benefit the continent. Of that, South Africa will benefit from US$6.8 billion in investment. African Union (AU) Summit. Cabinet is encouraged by deliberations at the AU Summit held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on 17 and 18 November 2018, where President Cyril Ramaphosa participated. The Extraordinary Session deliberated on the ongoing reform processes which are intended to establish an effective, efficient and re-energized AU that is capable of achieving continental priorities and goals set out in Agenda 2063, which is a strategic framework for the socio-economic transformation of Africa over the next 50 years. The reform of the AU is an ongoing process, with some of its recommendations already implemented, particularly in relation to the commitment to have member states of the AU assume greater ownership of financing the organisation. More countries continue to sign the African Continental Free Trade Agreement to ensure the Continent realises the continent-wide free-trade agreement. Strategic Partnership with the European Union (EU). Cabinet is pleased with the positive outcome of the 7th South Africa – EU Summit held on 15 November in Belgium. The outcomes and commitments made at the summit build on our unprecedented drive to place economic growth and job creation at the centre of South Africa’s national agenda. South Africa is the only African country and one of the 10 countries globally that has a Strategic Partnership with the EThe EU is South Africa’s largest trading partner and largest foreign investor as a bloc, representing 73.7% of total Foreign Direct Investment stocks in the country. President Ramaphosa this week hosted the President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Mr Frank-Walter Steinmeier, on a State Visit to South Africa. Germany is one of the largest foreign investors in South Africa, with more than 600 German companies having subsidiaries or production in the country, sustaining about 100 000 jobs. This State Visit resulted in the signing of trade and investment agreements between the two countries, and afforded both leaders an opportunity to discuss multilateral issues and cooperate closely as non-permanent members of the United Nations (UN) Security Council for a two-year term from 2019 to Land reform. Cabinet noted that Parliament’s Joint Constitutional Review Committee adopted its report that is in favour of amending Section 25 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996. The amendment will make it possible for the State to expropriate land without compensation in the public interest. The committee’s report is expected to be tabled in the National Assembly for debate. A public consultation process saw numerous organisations making submissions on the Bill and public hearings were held in all nine provinces. The Constitution has so far been amended 17 times through a consultative and inclusive process. Government remains committed to a responsible land reform approach that is in the best interests of everyone. Cabinet affirms that government respects the rule of law and will, at all times, act in accordance with the Constitution. Constitutional Court judgement. Cabinet welcomes the Constitutional Court judgment which ruled that the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act, 2002 (Act 28 of 2002) which governs the awarding of mining rights, must be read concurrently with the Interim Protection of Informal Land Rights Act, 1996 (Act 31 of 1996), which protects vulnerable land rights. The victory of the Lesetlheng community in North West signals a start to the recognition of land rights of which South Africa’s historically oppressed people had been deprived for generations. Where mining impacts on settlements, families and communities, people directly affected by mining must consent to any changes affecting their land rights. Audit outcomes. Cabinet welcomes and congratulates the government departments and entities that continues to consistently receive clean- audit outcomes. This comes after the release by the Auditor General (AG) Kimi Makwetu of the Public Finance Management Audit Report of the 2017/18 financial year. Cabinet is however concerned with the report that shows an overall deterioration in the audit results of some national and provincial government departments and their entities. The signing into law of the Public Audit Amendment Bill by President Ramaphosa, which will strengthen the work of the Office of the AG, will assist in holding accountable those that continue to have disregard for the governance framework. Cabinet encourages all departments and entities to work on remedial interventions on all the issues flagged by the AG and to monitor progress regularly to address issues before the next audit cycle. Safety and Security. Cabinet pledges support to the National Safer Festive Season Campaign that was launched by Police Minister Bheki Cele under the theme “Operation Quiet Storm”. The campaign aims to make South Africa a safer place as we approach the year-end holiday season. The South African Police Service will conduct nationwide operations in every town, village and township until the end of January 2019.They will focus on visible policing, whilst conducting special crime awareness and prevention operations. Cabinet appeals to all people in South Africa to continue cooperating with the police in keeping our communities safe. Parents and guardians are also advised to be extra vigilant in caring for their children during the upcoming festive season. Cabinet also pledges support to the 2018 Festive Season Road Safety campaign, launched by the Minister of Transport, Dr Blade Nzimande, in Limpopo at the weekend. The launch coincided with the annual two-day Road Safety Summit and the UN’s World Day of Remembrance for victims of road crashes. It is in the best interests of our well-being that we all play a part in ensuring a safer festive season by driving responsibly and obeying the rules of the road. Maputo-Catembe Bridge. Cabinet congratulates the South African engineers involved in the historic development of the longest suspension bridge in Africa. The Maputo-Catembe Bridge was built by the China Road and Bridge Corporation and connects Maputo in Mozambique and KwaZulu-Natal. President of Mozambique, Mr Filipe Nyusi, inaugurated the three-kilometre-long Maputo-Catembe Bridge, which was built over four years at a cost of US$785 million. This development will stimulate trade and tourism between Mozambique and South Africa with travel time between Maputo to Kosi Bay in KwaZulu-Natal’s East Coast border post drastically reduced from six hours to 90 minutes.
