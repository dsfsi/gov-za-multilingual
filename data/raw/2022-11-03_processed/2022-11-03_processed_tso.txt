Cabinet Decisions. National Integrated Small Enterprise Development (NISED) Strategic Framework Cabinet approved the NISED Strategic Framework for implementation.

It provides a structured coordination framework for all key ecosystem role players in small to medium enterprise development. In April this year, Cabinet approved the publication of the draft NISED strategic framework for public comment. Through the wide consultations, the strategy was enhanced by inputs from the public and from the National Economic Development and Labour Council, which is a forum comprising business, civil society, labour, academics and government that seeks to deal with economic, labour and development issues and related challenges facing the country. Draft Policy on Social Development Services to Persons with Disabilities. Cabinet approved the publishing for public comment of the draft Policy on Social Development Services to Persons with Disabilities.

The policy guides the Department of Social Development in the provision of its services to persons with disabilities and their respective families. It outlines the restrictive environment and barriers that continue to marginalise and exclude persons with disabilities from mainstream society, and from participating in social and economic activities. It proposes monitoring mechanisms that will ensure closer tracking of its implementation and mainstream interventions within the relevant departments. South Africa is a signatory to the UNCPRD and the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Africa.

Her election will send a positive message on the good work being done by female scientists from Africa.
