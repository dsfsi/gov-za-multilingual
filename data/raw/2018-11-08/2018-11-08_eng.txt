Job Creation3.1.

Cabinet is confident that the package of recovery measures, which will inject R50 billion into key sectors such as agriculture, public infrastructure, township and rural economies, will provide the necessary impetus for job creation and sustained economic recovery.3.3.

For the 3-months period, 92 000 additional jobs were created. However, because about 131 000 previously ‘discouraged work-seekers’ re-entered the labour market in the quarter, the unemployment rate also rose, by 0.3 of a percentage point to 27.5 per cent.3.5.
