Cabinet met on Wednesday, 24 October 2018 at Tuynhuys in Cape Town. Issues in the environment. Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS). Cabinet welcomes the maiden MTBPS by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, which is based on the strong conviction that South Africa can be renewed. The 2018 MTBPS highlights the difficult economic and fiscal choices confronting government over the next three years. Economic growth for 2018 has been revised down from 1.5% to 0.7%, and the global environment remains challenging for emerging market economies. The 2018 MTBPS gives effect to the President’s growth economic stimulus and recovery plan, which will be underpinned by fiscal and monetary stability. Government remains committed to fiscal sustainability, but there has been slippage since the tabling of the 2018 Budget in February this year. Government remains committed to stabilizing and bringing down debt. Against the backdrop of a difficult economic and fiscal environment, the proposed division of revenue continues to prioritise large social spending programmes that support basic education, health, social welfare, water, sanitation and electricity services. Presidential Health Summit. Cabinet welcomes the outcomes of the Presidential Health Summit which aim to address the various challenges facing the public health system. The outcomes will strengthen the preparations for the implementation of the National Health Insurance. Land reform.

President Cyril Ramaphosa led a land restitution ceremony, where over 4 586 hectares of land were handed to the community of KwaMkhwanazi in Empangeni, KwaZulu-Natal. The KwaMkhwanazi community will also receive post-settlement packages and support that will assist them to maximise the potential wealth of the land. This shifts communities from subsistence to commercial participants and owners of businesses across the value chains of the assets on their land. Government is committed to supporting the sustainability of emerging agricultural enterprises, which includes 262 land reform-related projects to benefit youth and women across all provinces. Destruction of public infrastructure. Cabinet expressed concern on the destruction of transport infrastructure. This undermines government's commitment to take services to historically disadvantaged communities. No amount of unhappiness should result in the destruction of public property. Such destruction serves to rob the poor of much-needed services. Cabinet calls on members of the public to be vigilant and work with law enforcement agencies to bring those responsible to account. Cabinet further noted that the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster will deal with this matter accordingly. National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) appointment process.
