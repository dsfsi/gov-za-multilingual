As we mark the 68th anniversary of the Women’s March and 70 years since the adoption of the Women’s Charter, a declaration of intent by the Federation of South African Women, which clearly defined the rights and privileges for women by women of South Africa.
This year, we celebrate Women’s Month as we also celebrate the appointment of Justice Mandisa Maya on her trail blazing appointment as South Africa’s first female Chief Justice of the Republic of South Africa. She also previously served with distinction as the President of the Supreme Court of Appeal since 2017 and was the first woman to hold that position.
The significance of her appointment can be best understood with this context. According to the International Association of Women Judges: “In 1994, there were approximately 165 judges, 160 of whom were white men, three were black men, and two were white women; no black women were judges at that time. As of February 2023, there are 253 judges, comprised of which 113 are women, broken down to 32% black women plus 13% white women making up a total of 45% women representation. Additionally, the remaining 140 male judges are comprised of 39% black men and 17% white men.”

A.  Issues in the environment
1.  Building a Safer South Africa 1.1.  Fight Against Crime1.2.

This arrest underscores government’s commitment to decisively deal with organised crime.1.3.

The multidisciplinary teams include anti organised crime, specialised operations and intelligence operatives. Cabinet reiterated to law enforcement that communities cannot be held ransom by criminals.1.4.  Cabinet also welcomed the arrest of the suspect found in possession of 34 passports by the Border Management Agency’s (BMA) at the Lebombo Port of Entry to Mozambique. This is part of continued efforts to stem out illegal immigration criminal syndicates that seek to undermine our border controls and immigration laws.1.5.  Fighting crime remains a shared responsibility between the police, communities and all sectors and the Cabinet continues urged citizens to work with law-enforcement agencies to combat crime in our communities.
1.2.  Fight against gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF)1.2.1.  Cabinet calls on the men of our nation to join the initiative by President Cyril Ramaphosa to take a stand against GBVF by signing the virtual pledge at www.stateofthenation.gov.za/endGBVF.1.2.2.  By signing the pledge, men commit to be part of the solution by maintaining positive behaviour and attitudes, and to take responsibility for their actions. It also commits the men to never raise a hand against a woman, to treat women as equals, respect their rights, and to treat them with dignity. Managing GBVF as a collective will result in healthier, safer and more peaceful communities in which women and children can thrive. 1.2.3.  Furthermore, Cabinet welcomed the opening of the 65th Centre at the Mitchells Plain Hospital in Cape Town earlier this week to support victims of GBVF. Government’s establishment of the Thuthuzela Care Centres across the country is a response to the urgent need for prevention, response and support for victims of violence, especially women and children.1.2.4.

Cabinet urges society and parents to help solve this challenge by reporting anyone who engages in sex with a minor (a child under the age of 16) as it is a criminal offence.1.2.6.  If the country does not work together to address this challenge of teenage pregnancies, women and young girls will continue to be trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty, lack of educational and economic prospects.
1.3.  Pre-release calendar for the publication of the quarterly crime statistics 1.3.1.

Water levels have now receded for residents – who were earlier evacuated – to return to their homes. However, the full extent of the damage is still being assessed, and the two available community centres remain open for residents who prefer not to return home immediately.1.4.3  As the country’s rainy season approaches in the northern part of the country, Cabinet calls on municipalities to ensure storm-water drains are cleaned and free from blockages to ensure the smooth flow of water when it rains.
2.  The Economy 2.1  Quarterly labour statistics 2.1.1  The official unemployment rate was 33,5% in the second quarter of 2024, it went up by 0,6 of a percentage from the first quarter (first quarter was 32,9%).

Statement on the Cabinet Meeting of 4 September 2024,05 Sep 2024,https://www.gov.za/news/cabinet-statements/statement-cabinet-meeting-4-september-2024-05-sep-2024,https://www.gov.za/news/cabinet-statements/statement-cabinet-meeting-4-september-2024-05-sep-2024,"A.    Issues in the environment
1.    Economic imperatives

Government remains steadfast in its quest to:o    grow the economy;o    reduce unemployment; ando    create a more resilient investment climate.

1.1    Notable developments on economic-related imperatives:
1.1.1    Gross domestic product (GDP) growth

Cabinet noted the slight increase in the growth of the South African economy by 0,4% in the second quarter of 2024, which sets a positive tone for our overall economic performance for the year. 
The growth is largely attributed to the finance, real estate and business services industry, which increased by 1.3%, each industry contributing to 0.3 of a percentage point to the GDP growth respectively. 
The trade, catering and accommodation industry, manufacturing industry and electricity, gas and water industry contributed to 0.1 of a percentage point to the GDP growth, whilst household final consumption expenditure contributed to 0.9 of a percentage point and final consumption contributed to 0.2 of a percentage point to GDP growth.  These industries have noted increase in economic activity in the last quarter.
South Africa’s economy remains robust and Cabinet encourages all sectors of society to build on this momentum going forward.
When all sectors build on this momentum as a nation, we will realise the creation of more jobs and improve the living standards of all South Africans.
Cabinet has prioritised inclusive economic growth and job creation for the Seventh Administration and therefore existing interventions will be intensified to achieve this objective.

1.1.2    Massive automotive sector investment

South Africa’s investment appeal continues to draw catalytic investments that affirm the government’s intent to drive economic growth and create jobs. Cabinet welcomes the launch of a R1.1-billion automotive components manufacturing facility at the Dube Trade Port Special Economic Zone in KwaZulu-Natal.
The massive investment by Toyota Tsusho Africa (Pty) Ltd and Ogihara Thailand Corporation Ltd is a vote of confidence on South Africa’s position as a formidable destination for foreign direct investment.
The investment also underscores the progress that has been made under the stewardship of President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has championed an investment drive that has attracted more than R1.51 trillion in investor commitments since 2018.

1.1.3    Boost to South African exports

The first batch of South African avocados arrived in Japan at the end of August 2024, marking a significant boost for the local avocado sector, and demonstrating the positive impact of the Agriculture and Agro-processing Master Plan, which aims to expand access to key new markets for South African producers. 
South African avocado growers now stand to benefit significantly as efforts to increase market access for our agricultural produce continues. India, China and Japan represent a combined market opportunity of over 2.5 billion people.

1.1.4    Energy Security

Cabinet commends Eskom, its board, management and all its employees who have worked tirelessly to ensure that South Africa will have no load-shedding this summer as the power utility continues to add more electrons to the grid through its generation recovery plan.
Eskom aims to keep unplanned losses at power stations below 13 000 megawatts as it works on improving the reliability of its power-generation fleet.
A reliable energy supply is vital for growing our economy, boosting confidence and enhancing the quality of life of our citizens.
Government continues to execute the Energy Action Plan, which has been instrumental in reducing the frequency of load-shedding through planned maintenance of Eskom’s power-generation fleet.
The reform of our energy sector is a critical component of our efforts to create a secure energy future for our people.

1.1.5. State-owned entities’ (SOEs) reform

In line with an undertaking that President Ramaphosa made previously before Parliament to recalibrate our SOEs, the responsibility for all our strategic SOEs has been transferred to the various line ministries, after the President had signed the relevant proclamation to this effect.
This step coincides with plans to create a centralised shareholder model through which the State seeks to better leverage the capabilities of our SOEs to grow the economy, improve service delivery, and infuse the SOEs with the requisite commercial and strategic agility.
The responsibility for power utility Eskom has been transferred to the Ministry of Energy and Electricity and Transnet, South African Airways and South African Express to the Ministry of Transport.
The state-owned diamond mining company Alexkor will be managed by the Ministry of Mineral and Petroleum Resources, aerospace and military technology conglomerate Denel will fall under the Ministry of Defence and Military Veterans while South African Forestry Company SOC Limited, which is responsible for state forestry, will report to the Ministry of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment.

1.1.6 Funding for development

The recently approved R17,8-billion funding from the BRICS New Development Bank (NDB) for infrastructure projects in water and sanitation will reduce infrastructure backlogs and ensure the provision of basic services to poor households.
The NDB has also entered into an agreement with Transnet for a government-guaranteed R5-billion loan to improve the freight rail sector.
Cabinet expressed appreciation for the funding, which will greatly accelerate infrastructure development in our nation and contribute to improving the lives of people.

2.    Social well-being imperatives

Government strives to:o    build a better South Africa for all; ando    ensure equity, access and inclusion to services.

2.1    Notable developments on social well-being imperatives
2.1.1    Presidential Health Compact

The quest for quality and affordable healthcare for all has moved a step closer with the signing of the second Presidential Health Compact.
The health compact is a framework for cooperation between critical sectors and stakeholders such as government, business, labour, civil society, health professionals, unions, service users, statutory councils, academia and researchers.
It seeks to strengthen the health system, and monitors and evaluates preparations for implementing the National Health Insurance.
The health compact seeks to bolster the development of human resources while improving access to medicine, vaccines and health products, along with upgrading infrastructure and ensuring private sector engagement.

3.    Fight against crime and corruption

Government has zero-tolerance for crime, fraud and corruption; and will hold those who violate the laws of our country accountable.

3.1.1    Unrelenting fight against crime

Cabinet remains determined to ensure that South Africa is a society where all people feel safe; and the recent arrests and conviction of suspects involved in various serious crimes demonstrates the commitment to push back against crime.
The increase in contact crimes in the latest quarterly crime statistics for the first quarter from April to June 2024 indicates that more still needs to be done to ensure every citizen feels safe.
The South African Police Service (SAPS), led by the Ministry of Police, is actively fighting these crimes. Recent operations include:

a confrontation with suspects in Milnerton, Cape Town, resulting in fatalities and arrests.
operations in the Eastern Cape, focusing on Mthatha and Nelson Mandela Bay.
arrests made in Gauteng, Mpumalanga and the Free State related to extortion activities.


Government is implementing a whole government approach, including:

signing cooperative agreements with provincial and local governments.
rolling out operational plans in Cape Town and Nelson Mandela Bay, with plans to replicate in all metros.
engaging with sister departments to improve collaboration against crime.


The National Policing Policy is set to be completed and adopted by the end of October 2024 to address issues such as police stations and infrastructure based on norms and standards.
Cabinet welcomes the signing of the Cooperation Agreement to Combat Crime in the Western Cape, which enhances collaboration and coordination among all stakeholders to address safety and security concerns. Through community-driven initiatives, the integration of resources and the development of innovative strategies, the agreement allows for a united front between SAPS, the province and communities to combat crime and promote public safety.
Consistent with the commitments made by President Ramaphosa during his Opening of Parliament Address on 18 July 2024 to build a safer country, our law-enforcement agencies have stepped up the fight against crime.
The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI), also called the Hawks, arrested 673 suspects during the first quarter of 2024/25, of which 506 were convicted and 77 court orders granted for the seizure of assets connected to criminal activities. The police also arrested 14 422 suspects for various crimes through Operation Shanela from 19 to 25 August 2024.
A multidisciplinary raid operation by the police, metro police, correctional services, Home Affairs and other law-enforcement agencies in six hijacked buildings in Durban led to the discovery of R4 million in counterfeit United States dollars, seizure of drugs, 117 rounds of ammunition and liquor, and arrest of more than 150 allegedly undocumented foreign nationals.
These successes follow significant inroads made in dismantling a transnational crime syndicate in the country since the beginning of the year. The DPCI has uncovered 10 clandestine drug laboratories and arrested 34 persons for manufacturing, dealing and possession of illicit drugs.
Cabinet calls on all South Africans to continue to work with law-enforcement agencies by reporting illegal acts to the police on 10111 to help keep criminals off our streets.
The fight against crime is a shared responsibility and government will continue to champion all initiatives that will mobilise all people in society to work together towards a better and safer South Africa.

3.1.2    Holding the corrupt accountable

Cabinet welcomes the preservation order of R6.5 million against those involved in looting funds at the National Lotteries Commission. These actions support the implementation of the Anti-Corruption Strategy, which brings together law-enforcement agencies in the fight against corruption.
Cabinet further welcomes the ruling by a London Court to allow the extradition of British national and former Eskom contractor, Mr Michael Lomas, to South Africa to face corruption charges. Mr Lomas will be extradited to face 41 serious corruption charges related to the construction of the Kusile Power Station. This ruling is also a vote of confidence in our criminal justice system and affirms our commitment to comply with international human rights obligations.
In his ruling, Judge Charles Bourne stated that the South African prison system has appropriate measures and can meet the needs of Mr Lomas.
The signing of a proclamation by President Ramaphosa authorising the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) to investigate allegations of corruption and maladministration at Eskom strengthens efforts to hold those involved in corruption activities at the State entity accountable.
The proclamation covers allegations of unlawful and improper conduct that occurred between 1 March 2006 and 30 August 2024, and nine contracts will be investigated. The President also amended a proclamation authorising the SIU to investigate further areas of allegations of corruption at the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform.
Cabinet applauded the 15-year sentence of the former Head of Engineering at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa, Mr Daniel Mthimkhulu, by the Palm Ridge Commercial Crimes Court. This sentence marks a significant victory in the fight against corruption and fraud within the country’s institutions. It further demonstrates government’s commitment to rooting out dishonest practices and ensuring accountability at all levels.

3.1.3  Fight against extortionCabinet takes a zero-tolerance approach against extortion

South Africa is learning from international best practices to develop strategies to deal decisively with incidents of extortion.
A whole-of-society approach and a unified effort from government, law-enforcement agencies, businesses and communities are needed to create a united front to combat this crime.
Extortion does not just harm individuals; it undermines our entire economy. By fighting this crime, we are protecting jobs, encouraging investment and promoting economic growth.
We are empowering communities to stand up against extortion. Through education, support networks, and confidential reporting systems, we're making it safer for people to say no to criminals.
The SAPS is being equipped with the latest tools and techniques to combat extortion, including advanced intelligence gathering and specialised task forces, to staying ahead of criminal tactics.
Extortion often thrives where there is a lack of economic opportunity. Government is addressing root causes by investing in education, job creation, and community development alongside our law enforcement efforts.
Government is working closely with international partners to share intelligence, track criminal networks and bring offenders to justice.
Our efforts are particularly focused on protecting vulnerable individuals and businesses who are often the primary targets of extortion. No one should have to live in fear in their own community.
Government is committed to a sustained, long-term effort to root out this crime and create lasting safety and security for all South Africans.

3.1.4    Fraudulent medico-legal claims

Cabinet is appalled that some unscrupulous and greedy lawyers and advocates have attempted to swindle billions of rands from the State through fraudulent and irregular medico-legal claims.
These wrongdoings were uncovered in a far-reaching investigation by the SIU into alleged fraudulent medico-legal claims against the State since 2017.
The ongoing investigation revealed that some legal practitioners at times with the help of health practitioners working for the State, have been targeting provincial Departments of Health, and matters completed by the SIU have resulted in at least R3 billion in savings for various Departments of Health.

3.    Governance imperatives

The Government of National Unity (GNU) is focused on enhancing state capacity to deliver on key government objectives.
GNU partners are committed to harnessing their collective will to improve the lives of all South Africans.
We have a clear resolve to foster a more responsive approach across all spheres of government – at national, provincial and local level.

3.1    Notable developments on governance imperatives3.1.1  Improving the management of water resources

Efforts to improve the management of existing water assets and ensure water security over the next decade has been boosted with the assent by President Ramaphosa of the South African National Water Resources Infrastructure Agency SOC Ltd Bill, which establishes a new agency that will be responsible for developing and managing national water infrastructure.
Cabinet welcomes the new legislation as signifying a critical step in the reform process to increase investment in the maintenance and construction of water infrastructure and improvement of water quality.

3.1.2    Local government audit outcomes

Cabinet notes the Municipal Audit Outcomes by the Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA) for the 2022/23 that show gradual improvement in financial management within some municipalities.
Nevertheless, there remains more work to be done to improve compliance across many municipalities that continue to receive negative audit outcomes.
The AGSA report shows only 34 of 257 metropolitan, district and local municipalities received clean audit outcomes.
On a positive note, the number of disclaimed audits decreased while 45 municipalities improved their audit outcomes since 2020/21 and those that submitted their financial statements on time improved from some 81% in 2020/21 to 94% in 2022/23.
Cabinet is encouraged that the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, together with the AGSA, continue to support and implement initiatives aimed at consolidating the improvements recorded in some municipalities. 
The department has also prioritised assisting the worst-performing municipalities in the country by improving the competency of personnel though training and skills transfer, as well as enforcing regulations on minimum standards for municipal managers and senior officials.

Cabinet received an update on the preparations to repatriate the mortal remains of South Africas freedom fighters who are buried in Zimbabwe and Zambia.Among the remains to be repatriated to South Africa are those of struggle stalwarts Adv.

A Homecoming Ceremony will take place at the Waterkloof Airforce base on 27 September 2024 when the mortal remains arrive in South Africa.    3. Acceleration of the implementation of land reform3.1. Cabinet received and considered the progress report on the acceleration of the implementation of land reform in the country. The Acceleration of Land Reform Programme gives effect to the recommendations of the Presidential Advisory Panel on Land Reform and Agriculture that presented its report and recommendations to Cabinet in 2019.3.2. The various land reform acceleration programmes continue to be implemented and the progress was reported to Cabinet as follows:i. Through the Transformation of Certain Rural Areas Act, 1998 (Act 94 of 1998), a total of 630 000 hectares was transferred;ii. Some 659 602 hectares of agricultural state land were released and allocated;iii. By 31 March 2024, some 83 205 land claims were settled;iv. Some 2, 895, 935 hectares of land were acquired at a cost of R26.4 billion. v. Financial compensation of R26 billion was awarded to beneficiaries. vi. Some 2 376 976 households benefited from the restitution programme.vii. The Commission on Restitution of Land Rights has planned to finalise 339 land claims in 2024/2025 financial year. 4. Lesotho-Highlands Tunnel closure for planned maintenance4.1. Cabinet was briefed on the closure of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project’s tunnel for planned maintenance from 1 October 2024 to 31 March 2025.4.2. The planned maintenance work is crucial to protect the infrastructure for another 20-30 years and failure to undertake this work will risk the transfer of water to the Integrated Vaal River System (IVRS), which provides the water supplied by Rand Water to its customers and all municipalities in Gauteng.4.3. A thorough analysis to assess the risk to the performance of the IVRS, which consists of 14 interconnected dams, was undertaken by the DWS. The analysis confirmed that the impact of the tunnel closure on the overall IVRS will be minimal as most dams in the IVRS are currently full.4.4. Cabinet noted existing water supply disruptions in Gauteng and in some Free State municipalities that are not related to the tunnel closure, and further noted that the DWS has supported municipalities to engage stakeholders in relation to the closure of the Lesotho Highlands Tunnel. 4.5. Cabinet further noted that in Gauteng, rapid population growth, lack of infrastructure maintenance, lack of enforcement of by-laws and delays in implementation of the phase two of the Lesotho Highlands project have contributed immensely to the current water disruptions. However, the completion of Phase 2 of the Lesotho Highlands project will bring relief if supplemented by water demand management interventions, use of new water-saving technologies and proper maintenance of infrastructure. 4.6. Cabinet noted that the DWS has held readiness meetings since February 2022 with the Free State municipalities receiving water from the Liebenbergsvlei River to mitigate risks of service interruptions during the tunnel maintenance. However, delays by municipalities to upgrade and/or refurbish their infrastructure remains a challenge. Cabinet noted that the DWS will monitor and where necessary, intervene to support these municipalities.5. Water restrictions in Gauteng5.1. Cabinet was briefed on the implementation of Level 1 water restrictions in Gauteng. This is a result of Rand Water reaching its maximum water output on the IVRS. 5.2. Water demand in Gauteng continues to grow because of population growth, increase in non-revenue water in municipal systems, including illegal and unbilled connections, and lack of maintenance resulting in huge water leaks, which are at 33% average across Gauteng municipalities.5.3. Currently, the peak demand for water from Rand Water’s municipal customers is close to and occasionally exceeds the supply available from its treatment plants and storage reservoirs. 5.4. To avert greater restrictions Gauteng municipalities must prioritise reducing water leaks in their water distribution systems and enforce water-use restrictions.5.5. The DWS, Rand Water and Gauteng municipalities are partnering with the World Bank 2020 Water Resources Group to implement mass awareness and communications campaign on using water sparingly, in collaboration with the civil society and business leaders.E.

5.2  Municipal debts to water boards5.2.1  Cabinet received an update on the ongoing outstanding municipal debts to water boards, which is rising and unsustainable, with a total of R23 billion owed by 31 August 2024.

The IMC will also prioritise measures to address municipal debt payments to water boards, particularly those facing imminent bankruptcy.
5.3  Water Restrictions in Gauteng5.3.1  Cabinet was appraised of the level 1 water restrictions that are in place in Gauteng due to continued water demand as a result of high consumption caused by population growth, illegal connections, leaks and misuse of water. 5.3.2  The average consumption in Gauteng is 279 litres per capita per day compared to the international average of 173 litres per capita per day. Whilst the metropolitan municipalities in Gauteng have level 1 water restrictions in place, very little enforcement is undertaken by the municipalities. 5.3.3  The Minister of Water and Sanitation and the Premier of Gauteng have requested the municipalities to impose level 2 water restrictions which will come with fines if consumers do not adhere to the restrictions.
5.4  Establishment of National Water Crises Committee5.4.1  Cabinet supported the decision by the President to augment the work that is currently spearheaded by the Deputy President by elevating the water matters as a crisis and establish a National water crises committee that will develop an water action plan and bring in water experts in order to intervene to the nation-wide water challenges in the Local Government space

The Bill amended the Divorce Act, 1979 (Act 70 of 1979) to recognise Muslim marriages and safeguard the interests of Muslim women and children if those marriages are dissolved.6.1.2  These long-overdue changes signal our country’s commitment to ensure that Muslim women and children’s rights to equality, dignity, access to justice as well as the best interests of the minor child, as enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996, are upheld. 6.1.3  They also give effect on fostering greater social cohesion, nation-building and a shared national identity as well as honouring various cultural and religious traditions.

1.  Group of Twenty (G20) Summit 1.1.  South Africa officially assumed the Presidency of the G20 on 1 December 2024, making it the first country on the African continent to lead the premier forum. The theme of G20 South Africa is “Solidarity, Equality, Sustainability”.1.2.

2.  Economy2.1.  Quarterly Labour Force Survey – Quarter 3 of 20242.1.1.  Cabinet welcomes the positive trend in the country’s employment figures, which shows that the number of employed people increased by 294 000 to 16.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, with the unemployment rate declining to 32.1% from 33.5% in quarter two. The largest increases in employment were observed in the Eastern Cape (83 000), Western Cape (75 000), North West (69 000) and Mpumalanga (49 000). 2.1.2.  Importantly, the total number of unemployed youth (age 15 to 34) decreased by 171 000 to 4,8 million while employed youth registered an increase of 66 000 to 5,8 million. Similarly, the number of employed women increased by 97 000 to 7,5 million. 2.1.3.  The positive employment trend is a result of concerted efforts and interventions which began during the Sixth Administration through the implementation of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan (ERRP) which are starting to yield results.
2.2.  Quarter 3 gross domestic product (GDP) decline in the midst of Positive Economic Outlook2.2.1.  Cabinet noted the decline in GDP by 0.3% in the third quarter of 2024, with the largest decline of 28.8% recorded in the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries, which may indicate the impact of drought as Statistics South Africa reports that the decline is primarily due to decreased economic activities for field crops.2.2.2.  Despite the third quarter GDP decline, Cabinet welcomed the positive economic outlook by the International Monetary Fund and rating agency Standard & Poor's (S&P) as the impact of the coordinated reforms implemented by Operation Vulindlela start to bear fruits. 2.2.3.  S&P also upgraded Eskom's long-term global scale foreign and local currency ratings from stable to positive, which indicates the progress made by government in strengthening Eskom’s financial and operational foundation through the work of National Energy Crisis Committee, Eskom Board and Executive team.2.2.4.  Cabinet further welcomed the decision by the South African Reserve Bank to cut the repo rate by another 25 basis points from 8% to 7.75%. The lower interest rate will continue to ease the burden on highly indebted consumers and mitigate the high cost of living whilst also encouraging businesses to expand their operations to further stimulate economic activity.
2.3.  Investment 2.3.1.  Cabinet welcomes the announcement by Saudi Arabia to invest R9.5 billion to build a platinum smelter and base metals refinery in the Waterberg region in Limpopo. 2.3.2.  This new investment is a strong vote of confidence in our nation and builds on the first phase of our investment mobilisation drive under the Sixth Administration that saw our nation surpassing its investment target by 26% to reach a total of R1,51 trillion in investment pledges. South Africa is now targeting R2 trillion in new investments over another five-year period between 2023 and 2028.
2.4.  South African Airways (SAA)2.4.1.  Cabinet commends SAA’s strong performance, highlighting the airline’s significant progress towards financial sustainability. For the first time since 2012, the SAA has recorded a net profit of R252 million for the 2022/23 financial year and group revenue increased from R2 billion to R5.7 billion.2.4.2.  Remarkably, SAA achieved this milestone while operating with only six to eight aircraft across nine destinations at the beginning of the 2022/23 financial year. The airline has since doubled its fleet, launched intercontinental routes, and increased its network to 16 destinations.

Cabinet reminds all spaza shops and all food-handling facilities that they are required to register with their municipality within 21 days from 15 November 2024 and to meet required health standards or face closure.3.5.  Cabinet calls on all South Africans to remain vigilant when purchasing food items, especially not to purchase items that have passed their expiry date.

Vendors and food producers are also urged to adhere to strict hygiene practices, including proper food storage, thorough cooking and maintaining clean food preparation areas.3.6.  Cabinet calls on anyone who sees counterfeit foodstuffs and expired items being sold in communities to report this to the National Consumer Commission on 012 065 1940.
4.  Safety and Security 4.1.  Crime statistics and continued fight against crime 4.1.1.

Additionally, rape decreased by 3.1% while robbery at residential premises and non-residential premises decreased by 1.3% and 21.1% respectively.4.1.3.  Cabinet also welcomed the arrest of a 39-year-old Mexican national for dealing in and manufacturing drugs as well as contravening the Immigration Act, 2002 (Act 13 of 2002) after a multi-disciplinary operation guided by police led to the discovery of a drug laboratory in Rietfontein, Johannesburg, valued at approximately R100 million. In addition, the South African Police Service, through an intelligence-driven operation, confiscated a container carrying cocaine with an estimated street value of around R86.5 million that came in from Brazil through the Durban Harbour. 4.1.4.  In addition, five suspected ATM bombers were killed in a shootout with police in eMalahleni, Mpumalanga.  The suspects opened fire on the police after they were cornered at a safe house in Schoongezicht in Emalahleni.4.1.5.  Cabinet calls on all sectors of society to partner with the police to strengthen the fight against crime. By working together, we can create safer communities and public spaces while ensuring criminals have no place to hide.
5.  Inaugural National Construction Summit5.1.  Cabinet welcomes the inaugural National Construction Summit held on 19 November 2024 by the Department of Public Works and Infrastructure to create crime free construction sites. The summit brought together stakeholders from government in public works and infrastructure, police, treasury as well as those in the built environment, to reflect on and agree on a common approach to ending violence and extortion at construction sites, which severely delay government’s large scale infrastructure projects.5.2.    Cabinet noted the signing of the Durban Declaration as an effort to build confidence in government’s ability to deliver projects on time and within budget in its quest to turn South Africa into a construction site. 5.3.  The declaration proposes a series of interventions to end the disruptions at construction sites to be implemented over the course of the next year. This includes strengthening legislation governing the construction industry, implementing appropriate policies for the development of the construction industry, improving data and reporting systems, and the arrest and prosecution of those responsible for extortion on construction sites. 5.4.  Work will also begin on supporting emerging enterprises and ensuring greater skills development. There will also be an intensified focus on collaboration on solutions to problems faced by the construction industry, which will be enhanced by establishing collaborative platforms for industry stakeholders to share best practices.

The launch of World AIDS Day coincided with the 2024 National Day of Prayer held at the FNB Stadium which brought together different churches to pray for our country.

Issues in the environment1.  2025 State of the Nation Address (SoNA)1.1. Cabinet expressed its support for the bold vision of creating a nation where all South Africans share in its prosperity and opportunities, as outlined by President Cyril Ramaphosa during his 2025 SoNA on 6 February 2025.  1.2. The President called on all South Africans to unite in action to reignite our collective vision and shared passion to build a South Africa that works for everyone. Through the planned National Dialogue, we will chart our nation’s course and forge a common vision for our country’s future.1.3. The new Medium-Term Development Plan (MTDP) guides government’s initiatives to create a more inclusive country that lives up to the commitments of the Government of National Unity. The MDTP aims, among others, to reduce unemployment, poverty and the rising cost of living as well as combat crime and corruption.1.4. The massive R940-billion investment drive announced by President Ramaphosa in new infrastructure and the upgrading of existing infrastructure over the next three years, puts infrastructure development at the heart of our country’s economic growth and job creation.1.5. The address outlined a clear path to tackle the challenges experienced at local municipalities, particularly in the maintenance of essential infrastructure. It also detailed intensive interventions to deal with the country’s water challenges, including the expansion of water infrastructure by investing R23 billion into seven large water infrastructure projects.1.6. President Ramaphosa outlined government’s commitment to support the well-being of South Africans through various social support initiatives in health, education, social protection, community development and public employment programmes, with around 60 percent of our national budget spent on the social wage.1.7. The President affirmed our nation’s sovereignty and constitutional democracy, and South Africa’s position to advance the well-being of humanity, and those around the world who continue to experience colonialism and oppression.1.8. Cabinet called on all sectors of society to support the initiatives announced by the President in his 2025 SoNA and partner with government as we set our nation on a trajectory for the year ahead.
2. United for South Africa2.1. Cabinet calls on all South Africans to rally in support of our great country during this period of misinformation, disinformation and propaganda aimed at misrepresenting our government and dividing our nation.2.2. We must not allow false narratives to divide us; we are a resilient nation that has more in common and our history has demonstrated that there is no challenge we cannot overcome when we pull together. We are called on to stand for the love for our country, which is rooted in our democratic values of non-racialism, tolerance, compassion, peace, justice, equality, freedom and human dignity.2.3. Given our past, we cannot turn a blind eye to human rights violations perpetuated around the world, nor can we ignore the less fortunate people who require our voice to ease their suffering. Cabinet reiterated President Ramaphosa’s firm position that our nation would not be bullied.2.4. South Africa belongs to all who live in it, and we are united in our diversity. Let us speak with one voice in defence of our national interests, sovereignty and constitutional democracy. Together, we are building a nation that encourages dialogue, fosters social cohesion and embraces all people, regardless of race.  
3. Economy3.1. Expropriation Act3.1.1. The Expropriation Act of 2024, which was recently signed into law following an extensive consultative process, is a constitutionally mandated legal process that ensures public access to land in an equitable and just manner as guided by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996. This law is not unique to South Africa, as many countries around the world have always had expropriation laws that balance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners.  3.1.2. Cabinet noted the executive order issued by United States President Donald Trump, citing concerns over alleged discriminatory policies and human rights violations purportedly perpetuated through the Expropriation Act. The executive order lacks factual accuracy and is rooted in misinformation and falsehood aimed at misrepresenting the actual purpose of the law and sowing racial divisions in our nation.3.1.3. Cabinet rejected claims that the South African Government is confiscating land and “treating certain class of people very badly”. South Africa is a constitutional democracy that is deeply committed to protecting the rights of all people living in the country in line with the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. Our Constitution was designed to create an environment for all South Africans to work together to address the legacy of our divided past, including land disposition that took place under apartheid. 3.1.4. South Africa remains committed to finding diplomatic solutions to any misunderstandings or disputes. Our country looks forward to engaging with the Trump administration over land reform policy and bilateral issues.
3.2. Tourism 3.2.1. Cabinet welcomes the latest international arrivals data that confirms that South Africa’s tourism sector continues to grow, with total arrivals reaching 8.92 million in 2024, marking an impressive 5.1% increase compared to 2023.3.2.2. The African continent remains South Africa’s largest source of tourists, with 6.8 million tourist arrivals in 2024, making up 76% of total arrivals. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, the tourism industry is estimated to contribute 8.8% to the gross domestic product and supports 1.68 million jobs. 3.2.3. Cabinet encourages all sectors to capitalise on the positive momentum by supporting our country’s tourism industry, warmly welcoming visitors to our shores and expanding domestic tourism by taking a Sho’t Left. Tourists seeking more information on South Africa’s many tourist offerings can visit www.southafrica.net
3.3. African Mining Indaba 3.3.1. Cabinet welcomed the country’s successful hosting of the African Mining Indaba in Cape Town from 2 to 6 February 2025 under the theme: “Future-Proofing African Mining”. The Indaba was first convened in 1994 and has over the last 30 years of our democratic journey grown into the world’s largest gathering of mining’s most influential stakeholders.3.3.2. This year’s Mining Indaba convened the community representatives’ dialogue to enable miners to understand the needs, concerns and potential impact of their projects on communities. It also helped equip community members to effectively participate in the decision-making process of mining projects.3.3.3. Cabinet welcomed the opportunity created by the Indaba to position the country as a competitive business and mining destination as well as showcase investment opportunities in the mining sector. Our nation’s mining potential includes vast resources of platinum group metals (PGMs), manganese ore and gold. In 2023, South Africa was the world’s largest producer of PGMs, the world’s 13th largest gold producer and South Africa has approximately 37% of the world’s manganese ore reserves.

South Africa’s G20 Presidency commenced on 1 December 2024 and all engagements are being held under the theme: “Solidarity, Equality, Sustainability” as we endeavour to ensure that no one is left behind.
4.2.  Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)4.2.1.  Cabinet paid tribute to 14 gallant South African soldiers who were killed recently in the DRC while undertaking a United Nations (UN)-backed peacekeeping mission.

Cabinet affirmed that South Africa would continue to play its peacekeeping mission role and support other African countries whose solidarity and material support helped secure our liberation.4.2.3.

Cabinet further welcomed efforts by the SADC leaders aimed at finding a resolution to the conflict and facilitating the repatriation of the deceased and injured soldiers of South Africa, Malawi and Tanzania. The outcome of the Heads of State Summit held in Tanzania on 8 February 2025 on the conflict also provides a beacon of hope for the troubled eastern DRC. 4.2.5.    Cabinet reiterated our nation’s commitment to a diplomatic solution that ensures stability in the DRC while also protecting the well-being of the Congolese people.
5.    Operation Vala Umgodi5.1.    Cabinet commended the efforts of the South African Police Service to combat illegal mining through Operation Vala Umgodi. The crackdown has since December 2023 resulted in over 18 000 arrests. About 1 700 illegal miners were arrested from August 2024 in Stilfontein. It includes the seizure of 458 firearms, 12 000 rounds of ammunition, 283 trucks, 303 vehicles and 84 big machinery from illegal mining. R5 million in cash and uncut diamonds worth R32 million were also seized. 5.2.    Cabinet welcomed ongoing efforts by law-enforcement agencies in the fight against illegal mining as Operation Vala Umgodi is rolled out to various parts of the country. 5.3.    Cabinet further commended the arrest of four police officers suspected of aiding the escape of illegal mining kingpin, Neo James Tsoaeli, also known as ‘Tiger’. It emphasised that police officers must always maintain the highest standards of professional ethics and remain beyond reproach. 5.4.    Cabinet calls on the National Prosecuting Authority to ensure that those involved in such corrupt activities are held accountable and get the harshest possible sentence.

About 615 429 learners passed the National Senior Certificate examinations and nearly half of learners who wrote the examinations received a Bachelor pass while nearly 320 000 distinctions were achieved.6.1.2.    The achievements of the Class of 2024 are a clear demonstration of the progress we have made as we commemorate 30 Years of Freedom and Democracy. They also provide proof that we are reversing apartheid’s planned legacy of intergenerational indignity, disadvantage and poverty for the majority of South Africans.
6.2.    Social grants 6.2.1.    Cabinet called on all social grant beneficiaries to replace their South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) Gold Cards with the new Postbank Black Cards by Thursday, 20 March 2025 to continue accessing their SASSA grant payments.6.2.2.    Social grant beneficiaries can go to their nearest Postbank site located at retailers such as Checkers, Shoprite, Pick n Pay, Usave, and Boxer to get their Postbank Black Card.6.2.3.    After the 20 March 2025 deadline, SASSA Gold Cards will no longer function at ATMs and retailers.  
6.3.    Festive road safety statistics6.3.1.    Cabinet noted that the preliminary statistics for the 2024/25 Festive Season Road Safety campaign showed that road fatalities, often a result of human behaviour, continue to plague our nation.   6.3.2.

E.    Upcoming events
1.    Human Rights Month
1.1.    South Africa will in March commemorate Human Rights Month under the theme: “Accelerating efforts towards social justice anchored on human rights”.

The painful legacy from apartheid’s skewed policies continue to shape our present reality and has led to many people being trapped in a cycle of poverty and unemployment. The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996, which lays the foundation for a free and democratic society, supports efforts to advance social justice through the redress of past injustices.1.3.    The recently assented Expropriation Act, 2024 (Act 13 of 2024) sets forth a constitutionally mandated legal process that allows government to rectify the bitter legacy of land dispossession and poverty by helping level the playing field so that more citizens can have access to economic opportunities, basic services and land. 1.4.    Our national Human Rights Day celebration on 21 March 2025 will take place in Kariega in Nelson Mandela Bay, Eastern Cape.
2.     Africa Energy Indaba 2025 
2.1.    South Africa will host the Africa Energy Indaba 2025 from 4 to 6 March 2025 at the Cape Town International Convention Centre. The Indaba is a flagship event on the continent as it connects industry leaders and showcases new cutting-edge solutions for the sector.2.2.    The conference comes at a time when South Africa’s energy sector is growing in leaps and bounds as the country works to secure its future energy supply. Last year government promulgated the Electricity Regulation Amendment Act, 2024 (Act 38 of 2024) towards creating a competitive and sustainable energy sector that can meet our nation’s growing energy demands.2.3.    In securing our future energy supply, 11 gigawatts of energy projects are scheduled for construction over the next three years. In December 2024, eight preferred bidders for Bid Window 7 of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme with a combined contracted capacity of 1 760 megawatts were announced.

The allocation of over R1 trillion to infrastructure development over the MTEF, the establishment of alternative infrastructure financing through a credit guarantee vehicle and the introduction of multiple bid windows on the Budget Facility for infrastructure is a demonstration of the commitment to grow the economy through a strong infrastructure-built programme whilst simultaneously improving service delivery. 1.1.3. Mechanisms for private sector participation, as announced with the Budget – which are part of Operation Vulindlela driven reforms in the energy, transport and freight logistics sectors – indicate government’s commitment to fast-tracking private sector investment and inclusive economic growth. 1.1.4.  Acknowledging the impact of the tax increases, the Budget provides for mitigation measures against the increases such as:1.1.4.1. No increase in the fuel levy.1.1.4.2. Above inflation increases to social grants, with old age and disability grants increasing by R130 to R2 315 in 2025.1.1.4.3. Significant funding allocation to the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa to improve passenger rail transport, which will reduce household income spend on transport costs.  1.1.5.  Most significantly, the tax increases are going to finance sustainability of this country, by maintaining 11 000 teachers in the classrooms, 9 300 health worker in their jobs, the employment of 800 post-community service doctors and allow an additional 700 000 children (four-years of age) access to early childhood development (ECD), which is the necessary foundational education they need for a successful education journey.  
1.2. Economic Growth1.2.1. The 0.6% increase in the fourth quarter (GDP) for 2024 signals a recovery across the economy, as the agriculture, finance, trade and household sectors grew in the last quarter of the year. 1.2.2. The agricultural industry rebounded by 17,2%, lifting GDP growth by 0,4 of a percentage point. The finance, real estate and businesses services industry grew for an eighth consecutive quarter, with financial intermediary, real estate activities and other business services being the largest positive contributors to growth.1.2.3. Cabinet is confident that the increased focus and pace of delivery on economic structural reforms, improved service delivery and state capacity, and increased participation of the private sector, will spur further growth of the economy in 2025 and beyond.
1.3. Investment 1.3.1. Cabinet welcomed the announcement by Microsoft South Africa to invest R5.4 billion in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure in the country. This investment will strengthen South Africa’s position as a leading AI hub on the African continent and builds on Microsoft South Africa’s R20.4 billion investment over the past three years.1.3.2. Microsoft South Africa also announced their contribution to developing South Africa’s digital literacy by paying for technical certification for 50 000 individuals in high-demand digital skills.1.3.3.

2.2 Humanitarian Aid to Palestine2.2.2 Cabinet condemns the refusal of Israel to allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip and its closure of border crossings at a time when the people of Gaza are experiencing immeasurable suffering and urgently need food, shelter and medical supplies.2.2.3 This action is a continuation of Israel’s use of starvation as a weapon of war as part of the ongoing campaign of what the International Court of Justice ruled to be plausible genocide against the Palestinian people.  2.2.4 Cabinet reiterates our nation’s call on the international community to hold Israel accountable and ensure the safe, continuous and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to all areas of the Gaza Strip.
3. Crime3.1. Welcoming the Malawi Court Ruling on the Extradition of Shepherd and Mary Bushiri3.1.1.

The Funza Lushaka Bursary will be reoriented to prioritise bursaries to students who wish to teach in the foundation phase.2.4.
