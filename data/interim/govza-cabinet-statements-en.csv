Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 30 April 2013,2 May 2013,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-30-april-2013,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-30-april-2013,"1. Cabinet s position on prominent issues in the current environment1.1. Cabinet reminds all South Africans that our constitution guarantees the right to strike and protest within the confines of the law. Cabinet has noted with concern the spate of violent and unprotected strikes which may become a threat to our democracy. The insults during the recent South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) directed at the Minister of Education and the display of women s underwear whilst protesting reflects total disregard for women and is unwarranted. South Africans fought long and hard for our democracy, and we should therefore disassociate ourselves from socially reprehensible conduct which is tantamount to anarchy.South Africa will soon be entering the period of salary negotiations and Cabinet wish to call on all communities, workers and labour unions to desist from any actions that undermines our democracy. Cabinet re-emphasis that our struggle for freedom and democracy ensured that our country s laws make provision for protected peaceful strikes. Cabinet reiterates its call on workers to use existing, regulated channels to address grievances and wage negotiations in the spirit of our hard-fought democracy.1.2. Cabinet commended the success of policies and programmes aimed at entrenching South Africa s status as a major international tourism and business events destination. This was confirmed by the Annual Tourism Statistics, which were launched by President Jacob Zuma. The Statistics show that in 2012, a total of 9.2 million international tourists visited South Africa, up from 8.3 million in 2011. Tourist figures to South Africa grew by 10, 2 per cent in 2012   more than double the world average of 4%.This remarkable growth in tourism is tangible proof of the warm and welcoming nature of South Africans and the range of tourism experiences the country offers. The 2013 Tourism Indaba in Durban from 11 to 14 May provides an opportunity to once again showcase South Africa and its people. 1.3. South Africa as an investment destination received a further boost by winning the European Outsourcing Association (EOA) Offshoring Destination of the Year Award 2013. This was made possible through the continued investment from global operators. The Award acknowledges destinations and operators that have excelled in servicing the European outsourcing market. The Award holds the potential for an influx of new investment in 2013 and beyond.1.4. Cabinet commended the success of the South African Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPP) Program which was recognised when it won the Green Project Infrastructure of the Year Award by Global infrastructure Leadership Forum.1.5. Cabinet appreciates the part played by all South Africans in helping the country save 3 586 Mega Watts (MW) of energy since 2005, the equivalent of the output of a single power station.In this spirit, Cabinet calls for a national effort this winter for further reductions in the use of electricity as energy supply will once again come under seasonal pressure. Together, let us conserve energy by switching off non-essential appliances. All South Africans have the power to keep the lights on.Cabinet highlights that currently there are no plans for load-shedding. South Africans will be informed in advance should the need arise for any such action, so that we can all plan sufficiently.Cabinet reiterates that the precarious energy situation is due both to essential maintenance as well as unintended technical issues including cable theft.Cabinet assures South Africans that various programmes are in place to ensure that electricity demand is met and that the integrity of the power system is maintained at all times. The infrastructure build programme aims to ensure that the economy is supported by the requisite infrastructure in the years ahead.1.6. Cabinet extends congratulations to all recipients of the National Orders and expresses its gratitude for their contribution towards the advancement of our democracy and for improving the lives of South Africans.1.7. Cabinet calls on all South African parents and guardians who have children from 9 months to 5 years of age to secure their health by using the nationwide polio and measles immunization campaign for children.The Department of Health began this immunization campaign on 29 April 2013, offering a booster dose to all eligible children, over and above routine immunization.1.8. Cabinet fully supports the United Nations (UN) Road Safety Week which takes place from 6 to 12 May 2013 under the theme of  Pedestrian Safety .Cabinet calls on all South Africans, especially motorists and pedestrians, to be more responsible, vigilant and cautious on our roads. Cabinet highlighted that pedestrians make up a significant proportion of road deaths in South Africa.Cabinet further calls on all South Africans to be vigilant during this period and observe all rules of the road1.9. Following the successful working visit by President Jacob Zuma to the Federal Republic of Nigeria in mid-April 2013, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan will conduct a State Visit to South Africa from 6 to 7 May 2013. During the visit, bilateral relations will be enhanced and discussed under the auspices of the South Africa-Nigeria Bi-National Commission.Cabinet reaffirms the South African government s commitment to strengthening its relationship with Nigeria to increase bilateral trade and co-operation for a better Africa.1.10.

Cabinet, on behalf of Government and the people of South Africa, expresses condolences to the People's Republic of China following a fatal earthquake in the country s Sichuan province on 20 April 2013. Cabinet also extended its sympathies to the people of Bangladesh who were affected in the factory accident..1.12. Cabinet welcomed the visit by the ruling party to former President Nelson Mandela. The visit was in line with the accepted norms of Ubuntu and how we value elderly members of communities.

Key Cabinet discussions and decisions2.1. Cabinet was appraised of South Africa s participation and priorities for the World Economic Forum (WEF) Africa 2013 to be held in Cape Town from 8 to 10 May 2013, under the theme:  Delivering on Africa s promise .WEF-Africa is a regionally focused economic forum that provides an opportunity for local and regional businesses and investors interested in the region to exchange and even explore partnerships with governments.Hosting the event will provide South Africa with an added opportunity to actively engage and lobby African leaders and international and regional businesses on possible interventions to integrate and enhance growth in South Africa and the region.2.2. Cabinet approved that the sixth edition of Development Indicators (2012) be published. The Development Indicators have become an annual publication and the 2012 edition summarises data on trends mainly for the period leading up to mid-year 2012. The indicators assist in understanding the impact of various government policies and service delivery initiatives.The trend analysis that is included for each indicator confirms our understanding of the human development progress that we are making as a nation in key policy areas and further points out areas where we need to put extra effort.  A special media briefing will be arranged to unpack the report.2.3. Cabinet declared 31 August 2013 as the cessation date in the Republic of South Africa for affected Angolan refugees. This is in line with the cessation declared by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) during October 2009, and gives effect to efforts to enhance regional integration.Fundamental changes have taken place since the end of the civil war in Angola. It is considered that Angolan refugees should be able to reclaim citizenship of their country of origin, because the circumstances that recognized a person as a refugee no longer exist.South African government will ensure that every Angolan citizen in South Africa is informed about the cessation process to affected communities and to encourage affected Angolans to voluntarily avail themselves for repatriation.2.4.

Cabinet approved the Information Communication Technology (ICT) Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) Roadmap as a long-term investment and implementation plan for ICT RDI in South Africa to support socio-economic development.RDI in the ICT sector is important for boosting the competitiveness of economies. As highlighted in the 2012 National Development Plan, South Africa has lost its status as continental leader in Internet and broadband connectivity.This Roadmap is an appropriate strategic implementation mechanism, consisting of a set of action plans and implementation frameworks, to guide and manage South Africa s investment in ICT RDI over the next 10 year.The ICT RDI Strategy has already begun yielding significant tangible achievements such as the wireless mesh technology demonstrator project, which supports the cost-effective delivery of broadband connectivity to more than 200 rural schools in Mpumalanga and Limpopo.2.7. Cabinet noted the hosting of the 2014 International Union of Architects (UIA) World Congress in Durban by the South African Institute of Architects (SAIA).SAIA won the bid to host at the 2008 UIA World Congress which was held in Turin, Italy.

Cabinet appeals to the leadership of both unions (NUM and AMCU) to resolve their dispute amicably and put the interests of the country and workers above everything else. Workers must be aware that the unprotected strike could have serious consequences not only for themselves, but for the future of the mine and that of their jobs.Cabinet also appeals to Lonmin management to do everything possible to make sure that the problems are resolved as soon as possible without further damage.

Government together with labour and business launched the Social Accord on Youth Employment in April 2013. This further demonstrates a collective commitment towards addressing the issue of unemployment. It maps out individual sector pledges to contribute in fighting youth unemployment with concrete targets and time frames for successful execution, monitoring and collective evaluation of the identified interventions.	Cabinet remains confident that measures already underway will assist the country to create new jobs and realise its target of five-million new jobs by 2020.1.6. Cabinet welcomes the signing of an action plan to implement the Memorandum of Understanding on Biodiversity Conservation and Protection between South Africa and Vietnam.

The focus of Child Protection Week and the Orphans, Vulnerable Children and Youth Conference is on child participation in our society and communities so that children are heard on matters affecting them.2.2.  Cabinet approved the National Aquaculture Policy Framework (NAPF). This policy provides a unified framework for the establishment and development of an industry that contributes towards sustainable job creation and increased investment.	The NAPF was developed against the backdrop of a global aquaculture sector that has seen an increased demand for fishery products. In South Africa, marine and freshwater aquaculture presents a good opportunity to diversify fish production to satisfy local demand, contribute to food security, job creation, economic development and rural development, and export opportunities.2.3.  Cabinet approved that South Africa hosts the Third Global Conference on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change in the fourth quarter of 2013, led by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.

The Global Conference aims to develop forms of growth that are socially and environmentally sustainable.2.4. Cabinet approved South Africa s ratification of the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Annex to the Southern African Development Community s Protocol on Trade and for this to be submitted to Parliament.	The SADC Protocol on Trade to which South Africa has acceded serves to promote regional cooperation and integration amongst member states for trade in goods and services within the region, including agricultural products.The SADC SPS Annex to the SADC Protocol on Trade provides an enabling framework for SPS cooperation.

Bills3.1.  Cabinet approved the publication of the Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Bill 2013 and Memorandum on the Objects of the Bill, for public comment.

This relates to extending the date for lodgment of claims for restitution, to enable those parties that did not submit claims by the closing date of 31 December 1998 or who were excluded from the process, to submit.	The re-opening of lodgment of claims is guided by the vision of the National Development Plan as well as the Comprehensive Rural Development Programme and other growth strategies intended to promote national reconciliation and social cohesion.3.2. Cabinet approved the submission of the Electronic Communication Amendment Bill to Parliament.

The Amendment Bill aligns the Act with broad-based black economic empowerment legislation; refines licensing issues; improves competition provisions; removes regulatory bottlenecks and provides for matters connected to this.3.3. Cabinet approved the submission of the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) Amendment Bill to Parliament. The Amendment Bill responds to some of the issues in the National Development Plan (NDP).The amendments of the Independent Communication Authority Act No. 13 of 2002 (ICASA Act) are underpinned by the need for institutional improvements to strengthen the independent Authority. This will be through the provision of clarity on aspects of its powers; to align the Act more closely to the requirements of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) and to improve its efficiency. This is with a view to improve accountability and transparency which will contribute to sound governance practices within ICASA.	Government needs to play a greater role to ensure that the electronic communications sector is regulated in a manner that supports overall national goals. This should not be read to suggest any limitation on ICASA s independence.	The importance of an independent and impartial regulator for the communications sector cannot be overemphasised.4.

Key Cabinet discussions and decisions2.1. Cabinet approved that the Green Paper on Policing be published in the Government Gazette for public comments.Since the establishment of the South African Police Service (SAPS) in 1994, there have been many changes in the internal and external environment that have impacted on the Service s understanding of and response to issues of crime and safety.Post-1994, government was faced with addressing the twin objectives of creating a developmental state while also transforming the police into an institution of governance.This Green Paper responds to the challenges identified following an assessment of the relevance of the 1996 Crime Prevention Strategy (NCPS) and the 1998 White paper on Safety and Security. Embedded in these policies was the notion of addressing safety and security in a holistic manner through the development and implementation of integrated cross-sectoral programmes.

Cabinet approved that the South African Weather Service Amendment Bill 2013 be published for public comment.This Amendment Bill seeks to amend the South African Weather Services Act, 2001 (Act No. 08 of 2001) which provides for the establishment, objectives, powers and functions of the South African Weather Service.In the main the amendments will provide the South African Weather Service with a legal mandate to implement the ambient air quality information management function, and to act as a custodian of the South African Air Quality information System.This contributes towards protecting and enhancing our environmental assets and natural resources.3.4.

For the first time in the history of our democracy, criminals who had abused public trust and resources were made known and held accountable for their actions publicly. South Africa s zero tolerance to corruption takes us closer to our vision for 2030 where South African society is characterised by high ethical standards and integrity.This aggressive stance aims to deter people in the private and public sectors from engaging in corrupt and criminal activities and is driven by our commitment to ensure that all citizens are and feel safe.	1.3. Cabinet condemns in the strongest terms the recent acts of racism in some parts of our country. There is no room for racism in our country and democracy, let alone in our schools, where the values of our Constitution ought to be promoted and defended.

Bills	3.1. Cabinet approved that the Disaster Management Amendment Bill be published for public comment.

This includes the implementation of a disaster management function for the municipal area.  The Disaster Management Act 2002 has a fourfold focus: It establishes an elaborate institutional framework for disaster management; it entrenches a detailed policy development and strategic planning framework for disaster management. The bill further provides for the classification and declaration of disaster; and it deals provisionally with the funding of post-disaster recovery and rehabilitation. It provides for disaster management volunteers and a few other ancillary matters.	3.2. Cabinet approved the submission of the Local Government Municipal property Rates Amendment Bill to Parliament.	The Local Government: Municipal Property rates Act became effective on 2 July 2005. It was amended twice in 2008 and 2009. The amendments seek to remove ambiguity and provide greater legal certainty.	The amendment will allow for transparency in the setting of rates for different property categories, thus enhancing property owners understanding of rating. The amendment will exclude certain public service infrastructure (PSI) such as roads, railways, airports aprons and runways, dams and breakwater from being rated. These are publicly controlled and will not disadvantage private sectors. This would enhance economic activity across municipal boundaries. It would also contribute to the developmental role of SOEs by reducing their fixed costs.	3.3. Cabinet approved a battery of Merchant Shipping Legislation for tabling in Parliament. These Bills form part of a package of measures designed to give effect to South Africa s obligations under the International Maritime Organisation Protocol of 1992.	3.3.1 The purpose of the Merchant Shipping (Civil Liability Convention) Bill is to: enact International Maritime Organisation Protocol, 1992; and to pass into law the amended International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969.

The Fund Convention establishes an international Fund, called the International Oil Pollution Compensation (IOPC) Fund. The purpose of the Fund is to pay compensation to victims of pollution damage (within the meaning of the Civil Liability Convention) where they have been unable to obtain compensation, or compensation in full, under the provisions of the Civil Liability Convention. The IOPC Fund receives its funds from cargo owners.	The Civil Liability and Fund Conventions Bills deal with questions of liability and compensation for loss or damage caused by contamination resulting from the escape or discharge of persistent oil from tankers.	3.3.3 The Merchant Shipping (International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Contributions Bill and the Merchant Shipping (International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Administration Bill provide for the implementation of the International Maritime Organisation Protocol of 1992 to amend the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Oil Pollution Damage, by South Africa.

Corporate stakeholders, trade union representatives, political parties and civil society organisations will participate in charting South Africa s third iteration of black economic empowerment with the amended BBBEE Act and refined BBBEE Codes of Good Practice.1.10 Cabinet applauds the Department of Social Development on their new service delivery improvement strategy called Project Mikondzo which will extend the reach of social services to the poor and vulnerable in every corner of South Africa.During Social Development Month, the Department of Social Development together with its entities, the South African Social Security Agency and the National Development Agency, will continue to roll out Project Mikondzo in the 1 300 poorest wards in 23 District Municipalities as identified and prioritised by Cabinet.1.11 Cabinet encourages South Africans to participate in the upcoming Imbizo Focus Week between 7 and 13 October 2013.Following the success of the June 2013 National Imbizo Focus Week, this second Focus Week will provide a platform for the Political Principals to further engage with the public.This period provides another avenue for citizens to engage face-to-face with Members of the Executive, to celebrate successes and to address challenges on implementation of government programmes. The venues and programme for the Week will be announced closer to the time.2. Key Cabinet discussions and decisions2.1 Cabinet approved the National Policy on Food and Nutrition Security, the Household Food and Nutrition Security Strategy and the Fetsa Tlala Food Production intervention.The National Policy seeks to respond to the many challenges related to food insecurity in South Africa. It is supported by specific intervention strategies to tackle the challenges of household food shortages as well as increase food production, so as to end hunger by 2030. The Strategy and the Fetsa Tlala Food production are Inter-Departmental programmes that underpin the Policy.A launch will be conducted to unpack the Policy and Programmes.2.2 Cabinet approved the Framework for South Africa s engagement with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for the period 2013/14-2016/17.South Africa seeks to utilise this relationship to achieve three key objectives i) higher, inclusive economic growth, a prerequisite for addressing unemployment, poverty and inequality; ii) a skilled and capable workforce, to support the delivery of the national development targets; and iii) Advancing the African agenda, where South Africa will seek to exert greater influence of the global agenda from which African economies can derive benefit.OECD countries remain key trade and investment partners for South Africa. It is estimated that OECD countries contributed more than 65% to global GDP in 2011.The approach provides a framework for government departments to manage their respective engagements with the OECD. This enhanced coordination in government would enable optimal benefits to be derived from the partnership.3. Bills3.1 Cabinet approved the Employment Tax Incentive Bill to be released for public comment.The bill introduces an incentive mainly aimed at encouraging employers to hire young and less experienced job seekers. The incentive is one among many that will fall under the umbrella of Government s youth employment strategy and will complement existing government programmes.The youth employment tax incentive targets young people entering the labour market and earning below the personal income tax threshold. In doing so, it targets lower skill, lower wage individuals who have low prospects of finding a job. The incentive will create conditions conducive to job creation and improve employment prospects for such marginalised workers. A planned briefing will be undertaken to unpack the Bill.3.2 Cabinet approved the Draft Land Management Commission Bill, 2013 to be released for public comments.Amongst others the Land Management Commission Bill, 2013 seeks to establish the Land Management Commission. The Land Management Commission will be required to adjudicate land ownership disputes in respect of which two or more title deeds may have been issued on the same land parcel.The Commission will also be required to establish and maintain a government wide database of all state land registered in the name of a department including any surveyed unregistered state land.3.3 Cabinet approved the submission of the Legal Aid Bill, 2013 to Parliament.The Bill is intended to repeal the Legal Aid Act, 1969 (Act no.22 of 1969) in accordance with prevailing circumstances, particularly the new constitutional dispensation, and to streamline its application.The Bill is intended to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of Legal Aid South Africa, which, in turn will have positive knock-on effects for society as a whole. It can be linked to the key targets of entrenching a social security system with social protection for the poor and other groups in need, and the realisation of a developmental, capable and ethical state that treats its citizens with dignity.3.4 Cabinet approved the publication of the International Health Regulations Bill, 2013 in the Government Gazette for public comments.The Bill seeks to repeal the International Health Regulations Act, 1974 (Act No. 28 of 1974) as well as to incorporate the International Health Regulations, 2005 into national legislation.The International Health regulations (2005) is international law which helps countries collaborate to save lives and livelihoods from events caused by the international spread of diseases and other health risks.3.5 Cabinet approved the introduction of the Medicines and Related Substances Amendment Bill, 2012 to Parliament.The Amendment Bill amends the Medicines and related Substances Act, 1965 (Act No. 101 of 1965) as amended by Act 72 of 2008. Access to quality, affordable and safe medicines and medical devices is a critical pillar of public health and contributes to the attainment of Government s goal of increasing the life expectancy of South Africans.3.6 Cabinet approved the publication of the Control of Marketing of Alcoholic Beverages Bill, 2013 in the Government Gazette for public comment.Alcohol is a major impediment to reaching government s outcome of a long and healthy life for all. The Bill seeks to reduce alcohol related harm through control of marketing of alcoholic beverages.While government cannot ban alcohol it also cannot ethically permit encouragement of alcohol consumption by allowing the public and especially the youth to believe that their life will be enhanced when in fact for many it will have the opposite impact. This intervention should not be seen in isolation but as part of comprehensive measures by government to reduce alcohol-related harm.A planned briefing will be undertaken to unpack the Bill.3.7 Cabinet approved the gazetting of two Bills, which both amend the Children s Act, 2005 (Act No. 38 of 2005) as amended by Act 41 of 2007 in terms of Section 75 of the Constitution and Section 76 , for public comment.The bill seeks to insert a definition of sexual offence to ensure that any person convicted of any sexual offences as defined in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related matters) Amendment Act, No. 32 of 2007, is deemed unsuitable to work with children.The Bill also aligns the Act with a Constitutional Court judgment to provide for judicial review of a decision to remove and place a child in temporary safe care with or without a court order within a specific period of time.The Children s Second Amendment Bill, 2013 aims to ensure that all children enjoy services and benefits aimed at facilitating access to social care and safety and to create an effective social welfare system. It also seeks to provide a safe and protective environment for the placement of children who are found to be in need of care and protection.4.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 9 October 2013,10 Oct 2013,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-9-october-2013,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-9-october-2013,"1. Cabinet s position on prominent issues in the current environment1.1. Cabinet welcomes President Jacob Zuma s signing into law the Transport Laws and Related Matters Amendment Bill as well as the Supreme Court of Appeal s dismissal of an appeal by the Opposition to Urban Tolling Alliance (Outa) in its e-toll challenge against the South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral).Cabinet believes these developments now allow the people of Gauteng and South Africans in general to focus on the benefits we have already gained - and still stand to gain - from improvements to the freeways in the economic hub of South and Southern Africa.The e-tolling system is one aspect of the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project which has enhanced the movement of people and goods and will make the provincial and national economy more efficient into the future.E-toll tariffs have been reduced in response to public comment; poor passengers have been taken care of through the exemption of public transport operators from paying toll fees; a monthly payment cap has been introduced, and a rebate system exists for transport companies. Cabinet calls on users of Gauteng s freeways to abide by the law, demonstrate good citizenship and make their contribution to a better South Africa by registering for e-tags and paying for use of these world-class roads.Cabinet urges South Africans to pull together and work together to make the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project a success and to appreciate the remarkable growth of modern infrastructure in the country.The Minister of Transport will announce the date on which e tolling will come into effect. Cabinet urges all the motorists who frequently use the Gauteng freeways to register on the system and purchase their e-tag so as to enjoy the discounted tariffs.1.2 Cabinet applauds the continued rollout, under President Jacob Zuma s leadership, of the multitrillion-rand public infrastructure programme, which includes the recent launch of the R71 and R81 to connect Polokwane to the town of Giyani and the opening of Bridge City and Rail Link project in KwaZulu-Natal on the 19 October 2013. An integrated road network is the key factor in attracting investment into the country and the continent.As we modernise roads around the country, Cabinet calls on all users to exercise caution when using the roads. Cabinet is concerned about the increase in incidents involving pedestrians on highways. Pedestrians account for at least 46% of the people who lose their lives on the road. Motorists and pedestrians have a responsibility to look out for each other on the road. Cabinet urges all South Africans to be part of the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety (2011-2020) being spearheaded by Department of Transport.Cabinet calls on all South Africans to participate in the Imbizo Focus Week which is currently in progress, until 13 October 2013.  This affords communities the chance to interact with the Executive on issues that affects them and also for the government to brief people on its work.1.3. On behalf of the people of South Africa, Cabinet thanks the Global Fund for their support to South Africa during a time when there is a desperate need for additional funding. This is the largest single grant for HIV and TB from a multilateral donor in the history of the AIDS response.Just more than half (52%) of the R3 billion will be allocated to the National Department of Health. Among other programmes, these funds will be used for the following: procurement of antiretroviral medicines for 350 000 patients, funding to pilot the provision of antiretroviral medicines by courier to patients  homes or pick up points in the community, TB screening services for all inmates at all prisons in South Africa, and TB and HIV screening for 100 000 mineworkers in small mines that do not have their own health services.1.4. Cabinet applauds the continued achievements of the Partnership against HIV and AIDS, which celebrated its 15th anniversary on 9 October 2013.South Africa is currently implementing the largest antiretroviral treatment programme in the world. The Partnership also played a significant role in the development of the National Strategic Plan (NSP) 2012-2016.1.5. Cabinet commends the spirit in which wage negotiations were conducted and concluded in those sectors where fast and amicable solutions were reached.Social dialogue within the framework of labour legislation remains central to preventing strike-related violence.As workers return to work, Cabinet urges employers and employees to work   together, particularly as the global economy remains under pressure, to make the South African economy more efficient, productive and to sustain decent work.1.6. Cabinet welcomes National Summit on Suicide Prevention in SAPS to be held on the 16 to 18 October.  This process aims to develop  the National Suicide Prevention Plan for the South Police Services1.7. President Jacob Zuma will receive President Francois Hollande of the Republic of France for a State Visit at the Union Buildings from 14 to 15 October 2013.The State Visit will deepen our bilateral political and economic relations with   France; strengthen North-South cooperation as well as further our African Agenda.2. Key Cabinet discussions and decisions2.1. Cabinet approved the Technical Regulations on Petroleum Exploration and Exploitation to be published in the Government gazette, for comment.2.2. Cabinet approved the hosting of the International Competition Network (ICN) Cartel Workshop by the Competition Commission of South Africa from 16 to 18 October 2013, in Cape Town.The ICN Cartel Workshop enables an exchange of views and networking on issues relating to cartels among its participating members and Non-Governmental Agencies around the world.2.3. Cabinet was updated on progress made in the first quarter of 2013/14 on the Youth Employment Accord signed on 18 April 2013.The six main areas of this Accord are (1) education and training, (2) work exposure, (3) youth brigades, (4) youth target set asides, (5) youth entrepreneurship and co-ops and (6) private-sector initiatives.The key achievement for the first quarter entails the initial audit of the youth activities and initiatives across the state and some action being undertake in the private sector3. Bills3.1 Cabinet approved the publication of the Draft Extension of Security of Tenure Amendment Bill for public comment.The Amendment Bill amends the Extension of Security of  Tenure Act, 1997 (Act No 62 of 1997) in order to strengthen, clarify and protect the tenure rights of occupiers (farm dwellers).The Bill aims to find a sustainable solution to tenure insecurities by combining land redistribution measures with effective legal protection and dispute resolution mechanisms. The Bill seeks to improve the rights of farm workers and dwellers. Secondary farm dwellers are mostly women and children.3.2 Cabinet approved the publication of the Draft Amendment Bill of the Mine Health and Safety Act, 2013 in the Government Gazette, for public comments.The Bill seeks to amend the Mine Health and Safety Act 29 of 1996 so as to review the enforcement provisions, simplify the fine system and strengthen penalties.In improving the health and safety of mine employees, the Draft Amendment Bill also seeks to maintain a healthy and safe mine environment with a positive impact on environmental sustainability and resilience in line with the National Development Plan.4.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 23 October 2013,24 Oct 2013,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-23-october-2013,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-23-october-2013,"Cabinet held its ordinary meeting in Cape Town on 23 October 2013.1. Cabinet s position on prominent issues in the current environment1.1 Cabinet welcomed the progress we are seeing in the country s public infrastructure roll-out campaign coordinated by the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission. President Jacob Zuma recently launched a number of completed projects as part of the Infrastructure Development programme. These include work on the R81 and R71 roads in Limpopo, the Bridge City train station that will service Umlazi in Durban and the sod-turning ceremony at De Beers  Venetia Mine in Vhembe, Limpopo.The President is also due to launch other infrastructure programmes such as the Saldanha Bay Industrial Development Zone (IDZ) in the Western Cape; pay a site visit to the De Hoop Dam, Limpopo, launch the first automotive wagons built in South Africa in the Eastern Cape, and officially open the Ladybrand Hospital in the Free State.Cabinet also welcomed the progress on the Johannesburg, Tshwane, Cape Town and Rustenburg Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems. This countrywide multi-trillion rand infrastructure programme is reshaping the economy and the transport system in our country.These projects have had the effect of poising the economy for a higher growth trajectory and will continue to contribute to economic development and job creation.1.2 Cabinet welcomes the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement presented by the Minister of Finance.  Cabinet supports the austerity measures propose for government. These measures will go a long way in reducing any wastage in government spending. Such measures will ensure that government uses its resources effectively and efficiently. Cabinet calls on all national and provincial departments, municipalities, public entities and constitutional institutions to implement these measures.1.3 Cabinet joined President Jacob Zuma and the South African public in condemning abuse, violence and neglect against children. Cabinet commended the law enforcement agencies for their swift action in recently reported cases.As we mark National Children s Day on 2 November, Cabinet urges all South Africans to protect children as they are our future leaders. Cabinet also calls on communities to continue to work with law enforcement agencies in fighting crime within communities.We should also be mindful that the protection of children is the responsibility of parents and communities. We should offer assistance to mothers who needs help to raise their children.1.4 Cabinet welcomed the announcement by Umalusi that the country is ready for the National Senior Certificate examinations from 28 October to 29 November 2013. Cabinet wishes all 707 136 candidates, including 130 000 part-time learners, well in their examinations.Parents and guardians are urged to support their children as they prepare for their examinations. Cabinet calls on the Class of 2013 to make the country proud.1.5 Cabinet welcomed the launch of Fetsa Tlala (End Hunger) food security programme by President Jacob Zuma in Kuruman in Northern Cape on 24 October 2013. The programme will assist communities to produce food on communal and other under-utilised land. It will support smallholder farmers with infrastructure, development of agro-processing and the development of new markets, including state procurement.1.6 Cabinet welcomes the inaugural African Maritime Indaba which will take place in Sandton, Johannesburg, on 24 and 25 October 2013. The Indaba will be hosted by the South African Maritime Safety Authority and the maritime industry. The conference will provide a platform for various role-players to craft a development path for Africa s maritime industries and establish a Pan-African Partnership for the development of Africa s blue economy.1.7    Cabinet noted the coming State Visit by President Zuma to the Democratic Republic of Congo on October 29 and 30 2013. The visit will strengthen our bilateral political and economic relations with the DRC and further enhance our commitment to peacekeeping efforts and the Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Development (PCRD) programme in that country.1.8 Cabinet calls on all South Africans to support National Disability Rights Awareness Month from 3 November to 3 December 2013, which also marks International Day of Persons with Disabilities. The month will be celebrated under the theme:  Break barriers, open doors: for an inclusive society for all .1.9 Cabinet noted with concern the resurgence of violence and hostilities in the Republic of Mozambique.

These amendments form part of the 2013-2020   global gas emission reduction efforts that set out to avert dangerous climate change while protecting the developmental priorities of developing countries.2.2 Cabinet approved that South Africa s Combined Initial and Periodic Reports under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights be submitted to the United Nations. The report is an evaluation of achievements and challenges associated with giving effect to civil and political rights contained in the Covenant and our Constitution. It has a particular focus on human dignity and the right to equality since the dawn of democracy in 1994.3. Bills3.1 Cabinet approved publication of the draft Promotion and Protection of Investment Bill, 2013 for public comments. The bill provides a legal framework for investments and addresses the legal protection of all investors in line with Constitutional requirements.  The envisioned Act will enhance our ability to attract foreign investment and export growth to promote sustainable growth and development in South Africa. The draft Bill therefore seeks to achieve several balances between the rights and obligations of all investors in South Africa, the need to provide adequate and equal protection of foreign and domestic investors.3.2 Cabinet approved the introduction of the Rental Housing Amendment Bill, 2013 to Parliament. The Bill addresses certain interpretation and implementation issues which surfaced since the promulgation of the Rental Housing Act, 1999 (Act No. 50 of 1999) (as amended in 2008). The legislation aims to promote a stable and growing market which progressively meets the latent demand for affordable rental housing amongst persons historically disadvantaged by unfair discrimination.3.3 Cabinet approved the introduction of the Attorney s Amendment Bill, 2013 to Parliament. The Bill amends the Attorneys Act, 1979 (Act 53 of 1979), as an interim measure, pending the enactment and implementation of the Legal Practice Bill. It addresses disparities in relation to attorneys and candidate attorneys and also does away with law societies created in terms of jurisdictional boundaries of the defunct homeland system (Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Ciskei and Venda). The amendments will ensure the uniform regulation of the attorneys  profession throughout the country and will strengthen governance of the legal profession in the mentioned areas.3.4 Cabinet approved the introduction of the State Attorney Amendment Bill, 2013 to Parliament. The aim of the Bill is to amend the State Attorney Act, 1957 (Act 56 of 1957). The amendments provide strategic leadership for the management of and oversight over State Legal Services.

The Bill establishes in law the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating commission (PICC) and the National Infrastructure Plan as key mechanisms to coordinate and drive infrastructure development in South Africa. The Infrastructure Development Bill provides a legal framework for the build programme and helps improve its developmental outcomes and effectiveness.3.7 Cabinet approved the Draft Women Empowerment and Gender Equality Bill, 2013 for tabling in Parliament. The Bill seeks to establish a legislative framework for the values of non-racialism, non-sexism and equality as contemplated in the Constitution.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 6 November 2013,7 Nov 2013,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-6-november-2013,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-6-november-2013,"1. Cabinet s position on prominent issues in the current environment1.1 Cabinet welcomed the Goldman Sachs report, Two Decades of Freedom, which is a detailed account of 10 areas in which South Africa has made structural advances since 1994 and 10 areas in which the country has to take decisive action.	The report is welcome confirmation of government s own assessment of the performance of the country and it affirms the priorities for the future set out in the National Development Plan.	The report is a source of hope and inspiration and is an important contribution to public discourse at a time when South Africa has begun celebrating 20 Years of Freedom.	Government urges South Africans to work together and work hard to make South Africa even more successful and to concentrate their energies and conversations on these issues.	1.2 Cabinet welcomes the establishment of two new universities in the Northern Cape and Mpumalanga, the first to be built since the advent of democracy. The Mpumalanga University will open in January 2014. This achievement reflects the importance government and all South Africans attach to education as part of the nation s development. The new campus will also make it possible for Mpumalanga students  to study close to home and will generate a range of economic activities centered on servicing the university and its population.South Africa has made great advances in providing services and new institutions to the marginalized and needy communities. The destruction of these institutions reverses the significant gains we have all achieved during our new democracy.1.3  Cabinet further welcomes the announcement that Eskom s power plants Kusile and Medupi will deliver electricity in 2014.  The generating of electricity next year by Kusile and Medupi power plants will be another major milestone for the country s development and will demonstrate government s success in implementing a large-scale infrastructure development programme which is reshaping our economy and society.Sustainable energy is vital for domestic and industrial customers and opens up new possibilities for growing the economy   which has been a priority for this administration since 2009. With so many projects of this kind in progress around the country, South Africa has taken a number of important steps along its new growth path, and all South Africans should celebrate our accomplishments.1.4  Cabinet lauds the signing of the Treaty on the Grand Inga Hydropower Project, during the recent State Visit by President Jacob Zuma to the Democratic Republic  of Congo. This project will extend energy access in Africa and present immense  benefits for agriculture, mining and other sectors in the SADC region.	Once all the phases are complete, the project will bring renewable energy to half of the African continent. This project will stimulate job creation, skills development and technology transfers in participating countries and will benefit domestic and industrial users. This is vital for economic growth and competitiveness throughout the SADC region.	1.5  Cabinet encourages all South Africans, especially young and first-time voters, to exercise their democratic right by taking the first step of registering to vote on 9 and 10 November 2013.	Our struggle for freedom secured the right for every South African to be active participants in our democratic system. We call on all South Africans to honour our history and to continue to strengthen the legitimacy of our democracy.	Cabinet calls all voters to ensure the 2014 elections achieve a large voter turnout, as we have seen in every election since 1994. All the offices of the Home Affairs will be open on the dates of registration to facilitate the process of registration with the necessary documentation.	1.6  Cabinet commends the more than 3,6 million taxpayers who have filed their tax returns to date, helping government to provide much-needed services to improve the lives of all South Africans. South Africa is a much better place today than it was in 1994, due to the growing number of individuals and companies who are willing and able to contribute to the public purse from which services and amenities are funded.	Cabinet reminds taxpayers who still have to submit their tax returns that the       22 November 2013 deadline for electronic filing of individual tax returns for the 2012/13 tax year is fast approaching.	1.7  Cabinet condemns the recent spate of violence, destruction of private and public properties and looting of goods in Gauteng, the Eastern Cape and Western Cape. Cabinet commends the police for intervening and quelling the situation.	The destruction of public property deprives communities of much-needed public services and creates the additional burden of resources being diverted to restore and replace these services.	Government will not allow criminals to destroy structures and amenities where vital services are rendered. Vandalism helps no-one, and there is no logic to destroying one service in the course of demanding another.	Communities should fight all attempts by criminal elements to take the education of our children hostage by threatening to disrupt examinations.We should build communities where we respect and help each other, rather than fear one another.	1.8  Cabinet expressed concern about the statements in the public regarding the South  African Jews.

This takes South Africa closer to achieving its United Nations: Education for All commitment of halving the country s illiteracy rate by 2015. The campaign was launched in February 2008, with the intention to help 4,7 million adults above the age of 15 years to become literate and numerate in one of the 11 official languages.1.19.

The government task team reported to the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence that there was no evidence that the Department of Public Works had paid for the construction of houses for the President. Ministers from the JCPS Cluster have been invited to this Cabinet briefing and are available to answer questions on this matter.2. Key Cabinet discussions and decisions2.1. Cabinet approved the draft White Paper on Post School Education and Training:  Building an Expanded, Effective and Integrated Post-School Education and Training System .The draft White Paper sets out strategies to expand on the current provision of education and training in South Africa. It sets out to improve quality, integrate the various strands of the post-school system, and to set out modalities for ways in which employers in both private and public sectors can play an important role in the creation of a skilled labour force.The Paper emphasises inclusive growth and employment which is essential for the National Development Plan.The Department of Higher Education and Training will brief further.2.2. Cabinet was apprised on the Ministerial Committee report on the Review of the Funding of Universities and approved that the report be released for public comment by universities.The funding of universities is no different from the broader challenges facing the country, and includes addressing the plight of disadvantaged institutions while ensuring that changes made in resource allocations do not impede the ability of the advantaged institutions to remain internationally recognised and competitive.2.3. Cabinet approved the Bio-economy Strategy for South Africa.The Bio-economy Strategy is a science-based strategy to position bio-innovation as an essential arm of various line departments. It also calls for a close relationship with industry to ensure that biotechnology and bio-innovations are more market relevant and that they find easier application in South Africa.South Africa s Bio-economy Strategy provides an economic engine for the new economy that will in turn provide a basis for future growth.2.4. Cabinet approved the Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) High Level Proposal for Phase 3 (2014-2019) for implementation. The overall target of 7.5 million work opportunities over the five-year period (2014/2015   2018/2019) is based on the Public Employment Programmes target articulated in the National Development Plan.Cabinet approved the establishment of the Presidential Public Employment Coordinating Commission to coordinate and report on public employment programmes. This will be aligned to the work of the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission.The EPWP aims to increase its contribution to address the triple challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality. The current economic down-turn has negatively impacted on employment in the country and has increased the importance of the EPWP as a major government initiative for contributing to development and reducing unemployment.2.5. Cabinet approved the tabling of the Instrument for the Amendment of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, 1986, in Parliament for ratification.The principle aim of the proposed Amendment is to make membership of the Governing Body of the International Labour Organisation more representative by providing a means of appointment that takes into account the various geographic, economic and social interests of its constituent groups.In terms of furthering the African agenda and should the 1986 Constitutional Amendment come into force, South Africa stands to benefit in terms of the special characteristics as outlined in the instrument, to be elected to a permanent seat.2.6. Cabinet noted the adoption of the Recommendations on the Social Protection Floor by the International Labour Organisation and approved the tabling of the Recommendation in Parliament for ratification.The Social Protection Floor approach is an integrated set of social policies designed to guarantee income security and access to essential social services for all, paying particular attention to vulnerable groups and protecting and empowering people across the life cycle.2.7. Cabinet approved for South Africa to host the 4th BRICS International Competition Conference in 2015.The Conference provides a forum for the exchange of views among competition agencies and non-governmental advisors from BRICS countries.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 4 December 2013,5 Dec 2013,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-4-december-2013,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-4-december-2013,"1.

Cabinet welcomes the 16 African nations and their supporters participating in the third Orange African Nations Championship (CHAN) between 11 January and 1 February 2014 in South Africa. Hosting the tournament will allow South Africa to build on the positive legacy of the 2010 FIFA World Cup and the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, and further entrench social cohesion and national pride.The tournament also presents an opportunity for South Africans to showcase our country as a vibrant tourism, trade and investment destination.1.9 Over this holiday season, government is leading a range of campaigns in partnership with all sectors of society to ensure responsible and safe behaviour. Foremost among these are Healthy Lifestyles, Arrive Alive, 16 Days of Activism and World AIDS Day Campaigns. All South Africans must play their part in giving meaning to these campaigns. Government cannot do it alone.Over this period the increased visibility of law enforcement officials at roadblocks and search operations countrywide will ensure that South Africans are safe.Road-users are reminded not to drink and drive, or drink and walk. Those found guilty of transgressing the rules will be dealt with to the full extent of the law.1.10 Cabinet calls on all South Africans to take extra precautions to ensure that our children are cared for and kept away from harm.

Key Cabinet  decisions2.1 Cabinet approved the National Broadband Policy, Strategy and Plan referred to as South Africa Connect. This will contribute significantly to economic growth, development and job-creation. The overall goal is to achieve a universal average download speed of 100 mbps by 2030. To reach this target in a progressive manner, there are reviewable targets starting with an average user experience speed of 5 mbps to be reached by 2016 and available to 50% of the population and to 90% by 2020. Targets are also set for schools and clinics and general public sector connectivity. The rapid evolution of broadband technology means that these targets will be reviewed annually.	2.2  Cabinet approved the gazetting of the National Integrated Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Policy Green Paper for public consultation. The Green Paper deals with the need to amend policies and regulations to take account of the rapid changes in ICT in recent years. Among the issues it focuses on are telecommunications, broadcasting and postal services. Public hearings will be held in all the provinces early next year.	2.3 Cabinet approved the  amendments of the Broadcasting Digital Migration Policy relating mainly to whether the Set Top Box (decoders) should have a control system or not.  Among the criteria used  to decide on this were the following: the need for speed on digital migration, especially to release radio frequency spectrum;ensure that the government subsidy is used productively;stimulate the local electronics industry and create jobs;benefit emerging entrepreneurs;reduce prospects of the South African market being flooded by cheap Set Top Boxes (STBs) that are not fully functional;protect the interests of the SABC;be sensitive to rapid changes in the broadcasting and ICT sector as a whole;reduce the extent of monopolization and encourage competition by creating space for new players in the pay television market without unfairly benefitting from the Government subsidy;reduce the prospects of legal action from broadcasters and entrepreneurs that would hold-up the migration process.Taking these and other criteria together, Cabinet decided that the use of a control system should not be mandatory. The STBs will, however, have a control system to protect Government s investment in the subsidized STB market and the local electronics industry and, with rapid technological changes, for future use by broadcasters who might not want to use it now.	To avoid subscription broadcasters unfairly benefiting from the STB control system, government s investment in the STB Control System will be recovered from those subscription broadcasters that choose to make use of the STB Control system.	Cabinet urges all parties to move on from their previous differences and work together with the government in rolling out digital migration as soon as possible in the country s interests.	2.4 Cabinet approved measures aimed at assisting over-indebted households and strengthening financial stability.The Ministers of Finance and Trade and Industry were authorised to implement preventative measures to minimise the risk of over-indebtedness through future loans. This includes providing a joint programme of effective steps to assist currently over-indebted households, and also to prevent households from becoming over-indebted in future.	The Minister of Finance will also take steps to encourage employers to assist their over-indebted employees by investigating employees  emolument attachment orders for validity, and providing employees with financial wellness mechanisms.	2.5 Cabinet approved the White Paper on the National Environmental Management of the Ocean  Policy.    The policy sets out a coordinated sectoral management approach to ocean environmental management. This will allow South Africa to address the growing challenges posed by human impacts on the ocean environment more effectively, while at the same time maximising the economic development potential that the ocean presents.	2.6 Cabinet approved the final National Water Policy Positions and also noted the public consultation processes conducted for the finalisation of the National Water Policy Review.The new Water Policy Positions adopts the position of developmental water management, which addresses the linkages between water management and developmental and transformational goals of government. This considers the entire water value chain with regards to how water can contribute to achieving equitable, beneficial and sustainable development across the country	2.7 Cabinet approved the process of realigning Water Boards into nine Regional Water Utilities. This follows the final report on the proposed reform of Water Boards.	The core business of Regional Water Utilities will be to develop and manage regional bulk infrastructure (water supply and water resource) including financing, project development and ongoing operations and maintenance. This will enable better provision of support to local government, which is a key requirement of the overall sector reform.	2.8 Cabinet welcomed the implementation of the Human Papiloma Virus (HPV) vaccine, which will be administered six months apart, in 2014, to girls aged 9-10 years through the Integrated School Health Programme. This is in line with the World Health Organisation s recommendation.	The aim is to reduce the risk of girls developing cervical cancer later in life, and will contribute towards improving women s quality of life and increasing their life expectancy and also significantly reduce prevalence of non-communicable chronic diseases. 3 Bills3.1 Cabinet approved the gazetting of the draft Agr ment South Africa Bill, 2013 and Memorandum on the Objects of the Bill for public comment.	The draft Bill makes provision for the recognition of Agr ment South Africa, as a public entity. The Board of Agr ment South Africa is mandated to, among others, evaluate the fitness-for-purpose of non-standardised construction related products or systems for use in the construction industry, and for which a national standard does not exist.This will contribute to the creation of a dynamic and innovative construction industry that positively impacts on job creation while contributing to Governments infrastructure plans.	3.2 Cabinet approved the introduction of the Development Bank of Southern Africa Amendment Bill, 2013 in Parliament. The Bill amends the Development Bank of Southern Africa Act, 1997.	The strategic focus of the Amendment Bill is to enable the extension of operations of the Development Bank of Southern Africa to any national territory on the African continent and its oceanic islands.

Cabinet s position on prominent issues in the current environment1.1. The 24th State of the Nation Address (SoNA) since the ushering in of democracy provided a critical end-of-term assessment on the implementation of government priorities for 2009-2014. The introduction of the outcomes system in 2009 enabled evidence-based and results-oriented monitoring of implementation to ensure that government delivered efficiently and effectively.1.2. Following the State of the Nation Address and the Debate on the State of the Nation Address, the current series of Ministerial media briefings provides an opportunity for engagement with various Ministers who will elaborate on the President s Address. The end-of-term report for the period 2009 to 2014 will be supplemented by the evidence-based 20 Year Review Report which forms part of our 20 Years of Freedom celebration campaign.All South Africans are called on to Play Your Part in reversing the legacy of apartheid by celebrating 20 Years of Freedom, which demonstrates that South Africa is undoubtedly a better country than it was in 1994.1.3. Cabinet reiterates President Jacob Zuma s message on protest. Protest that threatens lives and property and destroys valuable infrastructure that is meant to serve communities,  undermine the very democracy that upholds the right to protest. As South African we all have a collective responsibility to build a society that respects the rule of law, respects one another and respects life and property.Cabinet assures the public that loss of life through negligence by the police in the course of dealing with the protests will not be overlooked or condoned. Likewise, protesters in possession of weapons or found burning public facilities or endangering the lives of others will face the full might of the law.Government will work with communities to improve living conditions in all parts of the country Communities are urged to engage with councilors in a bid to jointly and amicably resolve service delivery disputes. 1.4. Negotiations on wages between the platinum mines and the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) are being mediated by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). The CCMA has appointed senior commissioners to facilitate the process.Cabinet is confident that the parties will produce a mutually beneficial agreement that will protect the rights of the workers and protect the economy of the country.1.5. Cabinet welcomes the registration of over 80% of all eligible voters as a result of the successful registration campaign by the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC). In the spirit of celebrating and commemorating 20 Years of Freedom, Cabinet commends the IEC, political parties and members of society whose combined efforts ensured that more eligible voters registered.Cabinet further commends the active participation by those citizens who ensured that their names were on the voters roll.Eligible voters who still need to verify their registration details and those still needing to register should visit with their local IEC office before the voter s roll closes. The voter s roll will close when the President proclaims (publishes in the Government Gazette) 7 May as the election date. All eligible South Africans are called on to exercise their right to vote during the fifth National Elections. Cabinet calls on political leaders to instill political tolerance within their parties and supporters. This is critical to secure a free and fair election and to uphold the values of our Constitution.1.6. Cabinet welcomes the first round of the Human Papillomavirus Vaccination (HPV) vaccination drive, which will start on 7 March 2014. Vaccination against cervical cancer will be administered to girls between the ages 9 and 10. Parents and guardians of Grade 4 school girls aged 9 and 10 are encouraged to support this drive by giving their consent and discussing with their children the significance of this vaccination.This public health milestone, which is in line with the World Health Organisation recommendation, is expected to contribute to the reduction of cervical cancer among women and reduce associated mortality.1.7. Cabinet also welcomed the launch of the revised Contraceptive and Fertility Planning Policy and Service Delivery Guidelines on 27 February 2014 by the Minister of Health. (This will allow young women to complete schooling and pursue their dreams without the hindrance of unplanned parenthood. The Minister of Health will also launch a sub-dermal (under-the-skin) implant which is a new, long acting-contraceptive device for women.1.8.

It also provides an opportunity for members of the public to learn first-hand about the work and responsibility of the SANDF.Cabinet is pleased with the number of successful missions that the SANDF has carried out in the continent, like in Burundi which today has a stable government; the eastern DRC, where the SANDF has, as part of the Force Intervention Brigade (FIB), dealt a severe blow to armed groups, and its contribution to saving hundreds of thousand lives in the Darfur region of the Sudan.Furthermore, Cabinet has noted the successful prevention of piracy encroaching the Southern Africa region by the SANDF deploying in and patrolling the Mozambique Channel.1.9. President Jacob Zuma will undertake a working visit to the United Kingdom from 2 to 4 March 2014, during which he will attend the National Service of Thanksgiving to celebrate the  life and work of former President Nelson Mandela in Westminster Abbey, London on 3 March 2014.1.10. Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe will attend the 100-Year Anniversary of the  Unification of the North and South of Nigeria in Abuja on 27 February 2014.

Cabinet welcomes the convening of all social sector partners at the upcoming Expanded Public Works  (EPWP) Social Sector Conference to assess the progress of the EPWP and how it can be further expanded.The conference will be held under the theme:  United in action to accelerate employment creation through EPWP social sector.

Statement on Cabinet meeting of 5 March 2014,6 Mar 2014,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-5-march-2014,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-5-march-2014,"Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 5 March 20141.  Cabinet s decisions on current issues and upcoming events1.1 Cabinet reiterates President Jacob Zuma s call on government, business and labour to work together to grow our economy at a rate that is able to create more jobs.The State of the Nation Address and the Budget Speech laid the foundation for intensified  implementation of the National Development Plan over the next term of the new  administration.The 21st National Budget of this democratic dispensation indeed tells a good story of how we are transforming the country and advancing against the key challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment   and, importantly, doing so within our finite resources.1.2 Cabinet expressed its abhorrence at the recent murders of two teenage girls in the  alleged furtherance of cult-related rituals.  Such practices have no place in our country.  Given that the Constitution enshrines the right to life, any person found to have committed crime will be dealt with to the full extent of the law.1.3  Cabinet thanks all South Africans and corporates for their energy-saving initiatives, particularly when the national grid has been under pressure. While the country has the capacity to meet its current demand, all electricity consumers are urged to adopt energy- saving as a way of life.1.4 Cabinet congratulates all schools and teachers who have been nominated for the National Teaching Awards 2013: Via Afrika People's Choice Awards which will be held on 6 March 2014 at the Birchwood Conference Centre in Gauteng. These awards are but one of the ways in which the Department of Basic Education acknowledges and encourages dedicated and caring teachers in their efforts to develop learners as responsible citizens of a democratic, non-racial and non-sexist South  Africa. Cabinet also reiterates the rights of children to learn in a safe and conducive environment.1.5 Cabinet welcomes the Department of Science and Technology s continued support of the National Science Festival, known as Scifest Africa, to be held from 12 to 18 March 2014 in Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape under the theme  Into the Space .  This  annual event promotes science, technology, engineering and mathematics as career  opportunities to our youth and forges a better understanding of these fields among South Africans. Government continues to prioritise and promote the uptake of  Mathematics and Physical Sciences as part of developing the critical skills needed by our developing economy.1.6 Cabinet welcomes the announcement made by the CAPRISA Consortium on the  discovery of potent new HIV antibodies.  The research centres on how a KwaZulu-Natal woman s body responded to her HIV infection by making potent antibodies. The study, published in the prestigious scientific journal, Nature, describes how the research team  found and identified these antibodies in the woman s blood and then cloned the antibodies in the laboratory. The cloned antibodies were then used in a series of  experiments in the laboratory to elucidate the pathway followed by the woman s immune  system to make these potent antibodies. The new insights gained from this KwaZulu-Natal woman into immune responses against HIV bring hope for future HIV prevention and treatment strategies.  This discovery is no means a cure for HIV/AIDS and government therefore calls on South Africans to continue to have themselves tested for HIV or to stick to the antiretroviral treatment that is being offered to people who test positive.1.7 President Jacob Zuma will address this year s Human Rights Day celebrations on 21 March 2014 under the theme  Celebrating 20 Years of changing lives through human rights!  at the Sharpeville Cricket Grounds in Gauteng.

We all have a responsibility to ensure that our human rights record and history are preserved and strengthened for future generations.1.8 National Water Week will be launched at Bushbuckridge on 14 March and will continue with a number of events up until 23 March 2014.

The remainder of the week will also see the handover of waste water treatment works and bulk water supply projects in a number of provinces. This year s theme is  Water is Life - 20 Years of  Water Delivery for Social and Economic Development .

The Indaba was hosted by the  Presidency, the Economic Development Department (EDD) and the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA).

Cabinet encourages the public to participate in the Green Paper provincial hearings that  begin in Rustenburg on 7 March.

The 2014 conference will  review activities and decisions executed during the 2012/2013 period; the budget for  2014/2015, and rule on action needed to implement the Convention and its Action Plan. It will also determine how parties can embrace the  Blue Growth  concept as a way of sustainably managing marine and coastal resources.1.13 Cabinet extended congratulations to the South African National Under-19 cricket  team on their outstanding achievement in winning their maiden International Cricket Council (ICC) Under-19 World Cup in Dubai. The squad's inspiring performance serves to motivate all young athletes to aspire to greater heights.1.14 Cabinet noted the upcoming International Women s Day - 8 March 2014. The day provides an opportunity for South Africans to pay tribute to the achievements and sacrifices of South African women in our communities. South Africans need to reflect on the progress made by communities, society and the country at large in advancing the rights of women.While the Constitution provides the bedrock of values and principles, it is the responsibility of all of us to safeguard and protect women and ensure that they are empowered to participate as equal citizens in the development of our economy and country.2  Cabinet  deliberation and approvals2.1  Cabinet approved the initiation of a broader consultative process with the aim of  producing more professional graduates.

Cabinet s decisions on current issues and upcoming events1.1. Cabinet welcomed the release of the Twenty Year Review South Africa Report 1994 2014, by President Jacob Zuma, which is testimony to the progress government has made to ensure a better life for all.In the spirit of the Review being dedicated to former President Nelson Mandela, the Executive calls on all sectors of society to engage with the report, join in the 20 Years of Freedom celebrations and help shape the national discussion on our achievements and challenges.The Review confirms the progress we have made in building a non-racial, non-sexist, thriving and vibrant constitutional democracy, making South Africa a better country to live in.1.2. Cabinet reminds all sectors of society that 2014 has been dedicated to the 20 Years of Freedom campaign.April marks Freedom Month. All South Africans and international partners and stakeholders are invited to join the Freedom Month celebrations by relating their stories on how, through working together, we have changed the lives of South Africans for the better.As we make our way to polling stations on 7 May 2014, let us once again demonstrate that we are a vibrant, enthusiastic and peaceful democracy.Cabinet calls on all South Africans to be active participants in electioneering but to do so peacefully and with tolerance for the right of all voters to express their opinions publicly and make their choice privately in the voting booth.Law enforcement agencies will be active to protect this right, to ensure that all areas of the country participate in the democratic process, which is a product of our Struggle for freedom.1.3. As part of the national infrastructure roll-out plan of the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission, Cabinet draws the nation s attention to the following positive developments:1.3.1. De Hoop Dam in Limpopo will be commissioned towards the end of March 2014. This is the fourth biggest dam built since our post democratic dispensation. The Dam will help drive economic activity, create jobs and aid service delivery in the province and beyond.More than 800 000 people in the Sekhukhune area will benefit from secure and improved domestic water supply while new mining and agricultural activities will also benefit from the supply of water.Municipalities in the area, supported by national and provincial government, have invested an additional R3 billion in infrastructure to treat and distribute water to rural domestic and urban users.1.3.2. Cabinet expressed satisfaction at the planned launch of the Lesotho Highlands Project Phase II on 27 March 2014. The Project is a prime example of what can be achieved when neighbouring countries cooperate and work towards a common goal. The development of mutual water resources is significantly contributing to the peace and prosperity of the Southern African region and the welfare of its people.1.3.3. Cabinet is pleased with the move to revitalise South Africa s rail system, with the awarding of a R50 billion contract by Transnet for the building of 1 064 modern and technologically advanced locomotives.Transnet Engineering s role in the agreement is to ensure that the division is transformed into a global original equipment manufacturer over time. This transaction is intended to transform the South African rail industry by growing existing small businesses and creating new ones.1.4. Cabinet welcomes the launch of the first MeerKAT antenna by the Department of Science and Technology at the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) core site near Carnarvon, in the Northern Cape on 27 March 2014.The MeerKAT, which is predominantly a locally designed and built instrument, again demonstrates that South Africa can compete with the best when it comes to research, engineering, science and technology. It will constitute 25 per cent of the SKA Phase 1.1.5  Cabinet expresses condolences to the families and friends of those who lost their lives as a result of the recent heavy rains. Cabinet reassures South Africans that the National Disaster Management Centre   through the National Joint Operational and Intelligence (NATJOINT) structure - will continue with search and rescue efforts and  humanitarian relief. Cabinet commends the intervention by security forces to aid rescue efforts.All South Africans, especially communities living in flood prone areas, are urged to take extra precautions during periods of extreme weather conditions. Parents and guardians must take precautionary measures to ensure the safety of children. Additionally, motorists and pedestrians need to remain vigilant when using roads in wet conditions.1.6 Cabinet expresses its gratitude to the public for the part they played in relieving the pressure on the national power grid over the last month.Individual consumers and corporates are encouraged to continue using electricity wisely and conserve power whenever possible, especially during the current weather conditions.1.7 South Africa will be attending the Fourth European Union (EU)-Africa Summit taking place in Brussels, Belgium on 2 and 3 April 2014.

Government s actions in implementing the biggest HIV and AIDS treatment and prevention programme in the World have stemmed the tide of TB.Government programmes to combat TB also included active case finding and contact tracing, the use of GeneXpert technology to expedite TB diagnosis. We pride ourselves on the fact that South Africa is the World leader in the coverage of health facilities with GeneXpert technology.Cabinet welcomes the upcoming Ministerial Symposium on Harmonisation of Regional Response to TB in the Mining Sector in Southern Africa. The Symposium which will be held at the Sandton Convention Centre on 25 March 2014 will bring together role players in governments of the Region, the Mining Sector in South Africa, organised Labour, Development Partners and Civil Society.1.9 Cabinet congratulated all finalists and recipients of the Second Annual South African Premier Business Awards.The Awards recognise performance by businesses in various categories and were bestowed at an event attended by President Jacob Zuma.Among the recipients congratulated by Cabinet is Mr Sam Motsuenyane who deservedly received a Lifetime Achievement Award.1.10 Cabinet noted the forensic report that was commissioned by National Treasury on the Independent Electorate Commission (IEC). This follows the recommendation made in the Public Protector s report.  It has tasked the Minister of Home Affairs to follow up on the matter and advise Cabinet.1.11 Cabinet condemns the persistent gangsterism in the Western Cape, which is characterised by vicious and brutal attacks on communities and especially children.

Cabinet approved that Section 100 (1) (b) interventions in Limpopo be maintained, in order to allow for a review in June 2014 after the new administration is in place. This will ensure continuity of interventions to address outstanding challenges. This will ensure that improvements in the provinces financial position and service delivery in social services and other sectors are maintained.2.5. Cabinet approved the South African Defence Review 2014, and directed that it be tabled in Parliament. The Review provides a long term defense policy and Defense strategic trajectory to be pursued by the country over the next four Medium Term Strategic Framework periods. The document will be shared with the public, as they participated in the public consultations that were held across the country in the past year2.6 Cabinet approved that the Report of the Ministerial Committee on Articulation Policy be published in the Government Gazette for public comment.The report analyses the post-school education and training system in its socio-economic context. It provides recommendations to the Minister of Higher Education and Training on how to remove unnecessary obstacles and bottlenecks that prevent or inhibit students  progression.The articulation policy refers to the systematic coordination of educational institutions, programmes and qualifications so that students are able to pursue their chosen learning pathways in an efficient manner.2.6. Cabinet approved the Report from the Ministerial Task Team on Mathematics and Science Foundation Programmes, be published in the Government Gazette for public comment.The Ministerial Task Team was mandated to develop a Technical Vocational Education and Training College-based Mathematics and Science Foundation Programme.This will help to increase the number of university Science and Mathematics entrants and enhance the innovative capacity as highlighted in the National Development Plan.The programme targets those who aspire to enter the Technical Vocational Education and Training sub-sector, those already in technical vocational education and training colleges aspiring to progress and enroll in universities, as well as Grade 12 learners who wish to enroll in universities but do not meet the Mathematics and Physical Science requirements.2.7. Cabinet approved the findings of the 2012/13 survey on public funding for scientific and technological activities are published.National Departments invested an estimated R29, 4 billion in scientific and technological activities in 2012/13, which represents 3% of the total national government budget appropriation. This is an improvement from the four year average of 2.9% between 2008/09 to 2011/12.It is also evident that government funds most of the scientific research that takes place in South Africa, and that the bulk of the implementation is located outside national departments, i.e. in science councils and higher education institutions.2.8. Cabinet was apprised on the evaluation by the Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation of  The Impact of the Introduction of Grade R on Learning Outcomes .Early investment in the growth and development of young children is likely to reduce inequality and raise productivity, especially in disadvantaged young children.Cabinet welcomes the significant achievement in the massive expansion of Grade R which needs to maximise its potential in order to have a more substantial impact on subsequent educational performance.2.9. Cabinet was briefed on the findings from the Frontline Service Delivery Monitoring Programme for 2013.Cabinet commends and is encouraged by the improvement from responsible national departments, of their strategic management and oversight of facility-level performance.Findings for the 186 facilities (monitored for the first time) across all provinces during 2013 revealed that the average ratings for dignified treatment, location and accessibility and opening and closing times were positively rated by citizens and monitors.Performance areas which require intervention are; complaints management, visibility and signage, queue management and waiting times and safety.Findings from the 77 facilities which were re-monitored to assess improvements also signaled improved average ratings, signaling positive signs towards managing facility-level performance as a strategic priority.2.10.

Statement on the Cabinet Meeting of 25 June 2014,26 Jun 2014,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-25-june-2014,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-25-june-2014,"1. Cabinet s position on current issues1.1. Cabinet appreciated the seventh State of the Nation Address (SoNA) which was delivered by President Jacob Zuma on Tuesday, 17 June 2014. The programmes which were highlighted by President and are guided by the National Development Plan will be unpacked in the coming weeks by the various Ministerial clusters. In the spirit of Together We Move South Africa Forward, Cabinet calls on all sectors of society to partner with Government in implementing the new Programme of Action, which builds on the achievements made over the past 20 Years of Freedom. 1.2  Cabinet welcomes the end of the five-month strike in the Platinum Belt. The prolonged strike had dire negative effects on workers, employers and our economy as a whole. While the right to strike is protected in our Constitution and labour laws, Cabinet appeals to both employers and the labour movement to resolve negotiations speedily and to avoid such prolonged strikes. The success of our development programmes depends on a stable and thriving economy. As South Africans, we all have a responsibility to grow the country s economy.1.3 Cabinet noted the downgrading of South Africa by the rating agencies, Standard and Poor s, and Fitch in the past week. Cabinet reiterates that government is alive to the growth challenges South Africa faces. Government has prioritized the accelerated implementation of the National Development Plan, with reforms that are aimed at unlocking South Africa s growth potential.Government is committed to improving the regulatory environment, reducing skills shortages and accelerating its infrastructure investment programme as part of removing obstacles that are constraining growth.1.4  Cabinet welcomes the findings of the 2013 General Household Survey which was recently released by Statistics South Africa. These findings confirm the good story that government s solid policies and programmes are changing the lives of South Africans for the better.The survey confirms that access to services such as water, refuse collection, housing and free education have recorded steady growth over time. South Africans with piped water increased to 89,9 per cent while the number of households connected to electricity stood at 85 per cent in 2013.Government s social grant programme continues to provide a safety net for families and communities who would otherwise be devastated by the scourge of poverty and unemployment. The number of people accessing social grants increased from 13,7 per cent in 2003 to 45,5 per cent in 2013. The percentage of households where people go hungry dropped from 29,3 per cent in 2002 to 13,4 per cent in 2013. 1.5 Cabinet noted the high-level South African delegation led by President Jacob Zuma that is attending the 23rd African Union Summit under the theme:  Agriculture and Food Security in Africa . The Summit takes place from 20 to 27 June 2014 in Malabo in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea.As part of the continent, South Africa will be making a contribution to discussions of the development agenda for Africa and will leverage the Summit to enhance the development programmes for the country.1.6  Cabinet commends the Department of Arts and Culture and the National Youth Development Agency for leading Youth Month activities under the theme  Youth Moving South Africa Forward .As we continue to celebrate the Youth Month, Cabinet reiterates government s programme of working with young people to change their lives and transform the country.  In the last five years alone, R2,7 billion was set aside for youth entrepreneurship finance support, student bursaries have doubled and early childhood programmes have enriched the foundation stage of children.  Such interventions will remain a focus for government, as we invite young people to become our partners in moving South African forward.   2. Key Cabinet  decisions2.1. Cabinet was apprised on progress we made in developing the National Climate Change Response Policy (NCCRP): Green House Gas (GHG) Mitigation Analysis. The report analyses South Africa s performance in effective management of the climate change impacts, and makes recommendations for South Africa s contribution to the global effort to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere.2.2. Cabinet further received a draft report on the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory for South Africa, for the period 2000   2010. This is in line with the United National Framework convention on Climate Change which South Africa ratified in 1997. According to this Convention countries are meant submit their progress reports every two years. The current draft report has been released for public comments.  It will be finalised to be ready for submission later in the year.2.3. Cabinet welcomes the approval of a new buffer zone for the Mapungubwe World Heritage Site by the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO which held its 38th Session in Doha, Qatar, from 15 to 25 June 2014. The new buffer zone is the result of a long consultation process involving land owners, community representatives, non-governmental organisations, mining companies and various government stakeholders. The approval of this new buffer zone is a welcome development for South Africa s efforts to improve the management and protection of its world heritage sites while allowing for responsible and sustainable development.3. Upcoming events3.1.  South Africa will be co-hosting a Partnership Forum Meeting with the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health at Sandton Convention Centre, Gauteng, from 30 June to 1 July 2014. The Partnership is a global organisation hosted by the World Health Organisation.Co-hosting the Forum provides a platform to focus on the importance of strengthening maternal, infant and child health in South Africa and to mobilise all sectors of society to contribute to this effort.The release of the Global Countdown on how the world is doing in meeting the Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 will also enable the participants from health and non-health sectors to take stock of progress and learn lessons.It will also promote greater accountability and responsibility towards women, newborns, children and adolescents, enabling them to realise their right to the highest attainable standard of health in the years to 2015 and beyond.3.2 South Africa will be hosting the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO). IMO is an annual problem-solving contest for high school students, held in a different country every year. This is an opportunity to showcase our country s ability to host world-class events and profile South Africa s top-class mathematicians. A total of 109 countries have already registered for this IMO.4. AppointmentsCabinet approved the following appointments:4.1.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 9 July 2014,10 Jul 2014,https://www.gov.za/sitatimende-semhlangano-wekhabhinethi-wamhla-yi-9-kholwane-2014,https://www.gov.za/sitatimende-semhlangano-wekhabhinethi-wamhla-yi-9-kholwane-2014,"1. Cabinet s position on current issues1.1. Cabinet reminds all South Africans to honour and remember our beloved former President Nelson Mandela during this Mandela Month by actively participating in the  Clean South Africa  Campaign.During Nelson Mandela Day on 18 July and more broadly during this month South Africans should dedicate at least 67 minutes to clean South Africa as per the call by President Jacob Zuma during the State of the Nation Address.Former President Nelson Mandela taught us that any individual can have a positive impact on their community. We all have a responsibility to honour his life by cleaning, improving and beautifying our communities.1.2. Cabinet welcomes the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) massive rail revitalisation programme. As part of this programme, the Minister of Transport unveiled the final design of PRASA s brand-new, modern and safe commuter train which boasts the latest technology the rail industry has to offer throughout the world. This is another special milestone in government s commitment to build infrastructure that will stimulate the economy and support local procurement. The first PRASA train is expected to hit the track in 2015.The modernisation of the train system will overhaul metro rail services -  a major catalyst for the transformation of public transport in South Africa. PRASA will spend R51 billion over the next 10 years to procure 600 top class trains for the people of South Africa. A total of 580 of these trains will be manufactured in South Africa at a new factory to be established in Dunnotar outside Nigel in Ekurhuleni at a cost of R1 billion. The  600 000 m2 manufacturing facility is designed to house the manufacturing plant, a training facility and fully fledged industrial park. The project will create 8 088 direct jobs, part of over 33 000 direct and indirect jobs over the 10-year period, achieving a local content level of over 65%. PRASA will train a total of 19 527 individuals (engineers, artisans, technicians, train drivers and, among others, technologists) during the life of the project.The Rolling Stock Fleet Renewal Programme is much more than the procurement of trains, it is about three pillars which will bring this industry to its former glory, revive our rail engineering sector and contribute to economic development and localisation.1.3    Cabinet welcomes the launch today by President Jacob Zuma of the First   Automotive Works (FAW) South Africa assembly plant and operations in the COEGA Industrial   Development Zone (IDZ) in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro in Port Elizabeth, in the Eastern Cape.The R600 million truck assembly plant, located in Zone 2 of the COEGA IDZ is funded jointly by China FAW Group Corporation and the China-Africa Development Fund. It is one of the largest investments made by a Chinese company.This plant will contribute significantly to national goals for socio-economic development as enshrined in the National Development Plan, New Growth Path and the Industrial Policy Action Plans.Benefits to The Nelson Mandela Bay and the greater Eastern Cape region include generation of foreign direct investment that will in turn create sustainable jobs and provide opportunities for skills development and training.1.4     Cabinet again condemns the theft of cables from rail, electrical and municipal public   infrastructures.  Such thefts hamper the smooth running of the economy of the country   and in some instances jeopardise the lives of people.  The law enforcement agencies will   ensure those arrested face the full might of the law.  Cabinet further re-iterates its commitment to clamp down on scrap metal companies that feed off and fuel this crime.Communities are urged to work together with government by reporting to the South African Police Service.1.5    Cabinet encourages taxpayers to submit their individual tax returns for the 2014 tax season, which opened on 1 July 2014. Taxes enable government to fund the country s development plans. Every taxpayer who submits an accurate return on time plays their part in moving South Africa forward.1.6 Cabinet welcomes President Jacob Zuma s signing of the Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Act, which signals the reopening of the lodgment of land claims for those who missed the previous deadline and provides claimants with another five years to lodge land claims.Whilst approximately 80 000 land restitution claims were lodged by the 1998 deadline, it is estimated that there are up to five times as many valid cases that can be brought by victims of apartheid-era forced removals.Cabinet calls on all South Africans to spread the message of this legislation to ensure that victims of land dispossession, who initially missed the 1998 deadline, come forward to lodge their land claims from 1 July 2014 until 30 June 2019.1.7    Cabinet congratulates the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) SA-funded researchers who discovered a triple supermassive black hole system. This is positive confirmation of the dynamic and significant radio astronomy which has developed rapidly in South Africa. The discovery further demonstrates that South Africa has the scientific and technical expertise to be a world leader in radio astronomy.This internationally recognised research is a reminder of the unique opportunities presented to South Africa as a result of our successful bid, to build our skills set by stimulating interest in science and engineering among our youth. It also provides the country with a basis to start producing scientists who will contribute to achieving Vision 2030 of the National Development Plan (NDP).This discovery is the beginning of many more that will be made possible with the Square Kilometre Array. Our successful bid has also opened many opportunities in the country, in particular thousands of jobs in construction, operations and maintenance in the Northern Cape where the core of the SKA is being built.1.8 Cabinet calls on young people to apply now for tertiary institutions in line with the Department of Higher Education and Training s Apply Now! campaign.Through this campaign learners are equipped with the necessary information to make informed career choices and apply on time. It will also contribute to averting the pressure that students face at the beginning of the academic year.Learners are also reminded to make use of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, which provides financial aid to academically deserving but financially needy students.1.9 Cabinet welcomes the outcomes of the recently held 23rd Ordinary Session of the African Union Assembly (AU Summit) under the theme: ""2014 Year of Agriculture and Food Security in Africa"" where President Jacob Zuma led a high level delegation.Of note are the Summits decisions on key issues pertaining to development, peace and security, climate change and the mobilisation of resources as well as the finalisation of the Agenda 2063 Continental Framework, as part of the vision of Africa in the next 50 years and the Common African Position on the Post-2015 Development Agenda.1.10 Cabinet sends condolences to the family and friends of African National Congress Women's League Deputy President and former ANC Chief Whip in the National Council of Provinces, Ms Nosipho Dorothy Ntwanambi. She has left a deep void in the ongoing struggle for a just and equitable society where all its citizens enjoy equal freedoms, rights and opportunities.2  Key Cabinet decisions2.1. Cabinet was briefed on the Outcomes of the 11th Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 11) to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), held from 16 to 27 September 2013 in Windhoek, Namibia.The convention addresses specifically the global issues of arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid in the environment.  Amongst the key decisions the Conference agreed on the improvement of capacity, effectiveness and efficiency of Regional coordination mechanisms and that Regional co-ordination Units carry out their functions effectively.  The conference further agreed on the relocation of the Global Mechanism from the International Fund for Agriculture Development in Rome to Bonn to be co-located with the UNCCD secretariat. The decisions will support the strengthening of capacity to deal with the challenges of desertification in the continent.2.2. Cabinet approved that South Africa ratify the Ban Amendment under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal.The Basel Convention is an international treaty that regulates the Trans boundary movement of hazardous wastes. While the Basel Convention Ban Amendment was adopted to protect developing countries from receiving imports of hazardous waste from developed countries.Ratification of the Ban would ensure that human health and the environment are protected for future generations, and that socio-economic development is promoted sustainably.This would make a significant contribution to reducing Africa s problems with dumped hazardous wastes.3. Upcoming events3.1. President Jacob Zuma, will lead a South African delegation to the 6th Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa (BRICS) Summit, to be hosted by the Federative Republic of Brazil on 15-16 July 2014 under the theme:  BRICS: Inclusive Growth, Sustainable Solutions"".During South Africa s tenure as Chair of BRICS, substantive progress was achieved in anchoring the new BRICS mechanisms that were launched at the Fifth BRICS Summit, i.e. the BRICS Business Council as well as the BRICS Think Tanks Council, and reports will be submitted to the BRICS Leaders on the work undertaken by these structures.The South African Government has fully implemented the eThekwini Action Plan, adopted at the last BRICS Summit hosted in Durban, South Africa, and will present a hand-over report on sectoral cooperation during its tenure as BRICS Chair, highlighting progress made by South Africa during its tenure as Chair of BRICS in relation to the decisions contained in the eThekwini Declaration and Action Plan.3.2. On Sunday 13 July 2014 the Department of Transport will be providing feedback to the Ekangala and Dr JS Moroko communities on the Moloto Road and Rail Development Initiative. The Moloto Rail Development Corridor will be an integrated public transport system which will have rail as a backbone and other modes of transport   buses and taxis in particular   providing feeder services.The leadership of Mpumalanga, Gauteng and Limpopo as well as district and municipal mayors will join the Minister during the visit. PRASA, a public entity under the Department of Transport, will lead this project from now going forward.3.3. Next week departments will be presenting their Budget Votes in Parliament.  Ministers will be sharing their expenditure plans through the Parliamentary process and further engaging with the respective communities on their plans.3.4. Cabinet conveys its best wishes to our athletes who will be participating at the Commonwealth Games, taking place from 23 July to 3 August 2014 in Glasgow, Scotland, and calls on all South Africans to support them.4.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 23 July 2014,24 Jul 2014,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-23-july-2014,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-23-july-2014,"1. Cabinet s position on current issues1.1 Cabinet welcomes the launch by President Jacob Zuma of Operation Phakisa, which fast-tracks delivery through detailed implementation plans, problem-solving and practical actions to drive growth. The Department of Environmental Affairs will be the first department to lead collaboration with the industry, labour, civil society and academia to work together to unlock the economic potential of our oceans.In 2010, the ocean economy   or blue economy, as it is also known - contributed about R54 billion to South Africa s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and accounted for approximately 316 000 jobs. Evidence shows that South Africa s oceans could contribute up to R177 billion to GDP by 2033. The ocean also has a potential to create between 800 000 and one million direct jobs. These growth levers reflect at least 4 percent annual growth in both Gross Domestic Product contribution and job creation.Marine aquaculture, marine transport, offshore oil and gas exploration and marine protection have all been identified as focus areas of the blue economy. A delivery lab has been established under each area to help resolve critical challenges.1.2 Cabinet thanks all South Africans and the world for participating in this year s Nelson Mandela International Day. South Africans from every part of our country answered the call to dedicate their time and energy towards making a difference.	The clean-up operation beautifies our surroundings and ensures the preservation of our environment. As part of this campaign, the Department of Cooperative Government and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) dispatched about 150 Municipal Technical officials across municipalities to take part in this clean-up campaign, but also to support municipalities throughout the year.Campaigns such as the  War on Leaks  will continue and be intensified where unemployed youth and other community members will be encouraged to join government in fixing water leaks. Cabinet calls on communities to keep rivers and streams clean and clear, as this contributes to healthy, safe and decent living conditions. Polluted rivers and streams threaten the livelihoods of downstream communities.1.3 Cabinet welcomes the agreement to launch the New Development Bank (NDB) at the Sixth BRICS Summit in Brazil and to establish the bank's regional office in Johannesburg. The NDB will strengthen the cooperation among BRICS member countries and will supplement the efforts of other multilateral and regional financial institutions, thus contributing to the collective commitments of BRICS member countries for achieving the goal of strong, sustainable and balanced growth.The regional office will play an important role in funding infrastructure and sustainable development projects in Africa. Built into the operating model of the NDB is a project preparation facility which will enable the realisation of a number of potential infrastructure projects on the continent. These have hitherto not been implemented because of the lack of funding for project preparation, a key step in making project ideas ready for funding and implementation.1.4 Cabinet expressed great concern over the escalation in violence between Israel and the Palestinian territories. Cabinet reiterates President Zuma s call on the Israeli government to stop its ground and air offensive, which continues to cause loss of life and a devastating humanitarian crisis. Furthermore, it calls for an end to the firing of rockets on Israeli citizens by Hamas.Cabinet is opposed to the veiled attempts by the Israeli Government to use its onslaught on Gaza to undermine the Unity Government in Palestine. There will never be a military solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The only solution lies in serious and genuine negotiations involving all parties. South Africa joins the UN Secretary General, Mr Ban Ki-moon, in calling for an immediate ceasefire by all sides, and a resumption of the flow of humanitarian aid to the suffering people of Gaza. The humanitarian situation is of great concern to Cabinet. Government appeals to the Egyptian authorities to open their doors to the injured and affected people of Gaza.1.5 On behalf of the people of the Republic of South Africa, Cabinet conveys its condolences to the families and friends of all the victims of the Malaysia Airlines plane that crashed in Ukraine on 17 July 2014.1.6 Cabinet conveys its condolences to the family and friends of the Nobel Prize-winning author Nadine Gordimer who passed away recently. South Africa will always remember Ms Gordimer as a brave activist who used her pen and courageous voice to speak out against the injustices of the apartheid regime.	Ms Gordimer was a founding member of the Congress of South African Writers (COSAW) and as a member of the African National Congress in 1989, she testified in mitigation of sentence for 11 United Democratic Front leaders and Vaal Civil Association activists. Her fiction, which played an important role in the struggle against apartheid, documented the effect that institutionalised racism had on the lives of ordinary South Africans.1.7 Cabinet sends it condolences to the parents of the 4 year old Taegrin Morris who was killed in a high jacking incidence in Reiger Park South of Johannesburg. Cabinet further joins in condemning such brutality especially on children. Cabinet further thanked the police and the members of the public that assisted in the safe return of Mongezi Phike who was recently kidnaped after they hijack his father.1.8 Cabinet reminds South Africans that the Chancery of Orders is inviting nominations from members of the public, non-governmental organisations, civic- and faith-based organisations for individuals deemed worthy recipients of National Orders.National Orders are the highest form of recognition that a country bestows on deserving citizens. The President as the Grand Patron of the National Orders awards these orders.	Members of the public are requested to submit names of an outstanding individual in their community using a form available from www.thepresidency.gov.za. This must be accompanied by a separate motivation covering the following areas:an introductory paragraph with summary of the nominee s achievements;a list of exceptional milestones reached by the nominee in his/her career and/or international arena; anda description of the exceptional, outstanding, dedicated service or act of bravery rendered by the nominee.The nominations will close on 31 July 2014.2. Key Cabinet decisions	2.1 Cabinet was briefed on the implementation of Section 100 (1) (b) intervention in Limpopo province and approved the transition of the intervention from section 100 (1) (b) to section 100 (1) (a) with clear conditions given to the Provincial Executive to fulfil as a pre-requisite, for determining full withdrawal.	In line with the Constitution the National Council of Provinces has been consulted. A separate briefing that will spell out what was achieved and the process going forward will be held early next week.	2.2 Cabinet approved the 2014-2019 Medium-Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) which will serve as the first 5-year building block towards the 2030 vision in the National Development Plan (NDP). The MTSF contains detailed five year implementation plans for the NDP, with targets, indicators, roles and responsibilities and timeframes for the implementation of key actions - to enable systematic and evidence-based monitoring of the implementation of the NDP.The MTSF builds on government s experience and learning during the 2009- 2014 administration, when outcomes-based planning, monitoring and evaluation were introduced for the first time. During that period delivery agreements were developed, monitored and evaluated for the 12 priority outcomes of government which included quality basic education, a long life for all South Africans, safety and security, inclusive growth and decent employment and rural development and land reform.	During the 2014-2019 administration the number of outcomes has been increased to 14, with the addition of two new outcomes - social protection and social cohesion and nation building. All in all, these 14 outcomes cover all the chapters of the NDP. The Ministry of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation will hold a media briefing on the MTSF shortly.2.3 Cabinet approved that South Africa hosts the Global Smart Partnership Dialogue in October 2014 under the theme:  Leveraging Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) for Socio-economic. Transformation through Smart Partnership Principles .The dialogue provides a platform for Heads of States, business leaders, scientists, academics and student leaders to exchange ideas and experiences related to science, technology and innovation. Furthermore the dialogue seeks to boosting socio-economic transformation, development and growth in Africa.The hosting will also address the aims and objectives of the National Development Plan on improving science and technology for socio-economic transformation in South Africa and on improving our innovative edge in the region, the continent and globally. 3. Upcoming events	3.1 President Jacob Zuma will launch Women s Month at the Union Buildings on 31 July 2014 under the theme:  60th anniversary of the Women s charter as part of the 20 years of Freedom, Moving Women s Agenda Forward!

The programme pays tribute to women who marched to the Union Buildings protesting against the pass laws in 1956.The first launch of this programme took place at Ratanda Township, Lesedi Local Municipality in Gauteng on the 4 August 2014.  A total of 17 604 houses will be built by women and the beneficiaries will be women, the elderly and child headed households as stipulated by Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu during her recent budget speech. Cabinet calls on all South Africans to support and participate in the Women s Month programmes and activities throughout the month to ensure that women achievements are celebrated. The National Women s Month Programme is attached.2. Key programme implementationCabinet welcomes and appreciates the progress on implementation of key government programmes which reflect our commitment to moving South Africa forward.2.1. The opening of the R30-million Transnet Wagons Refurbishing Facility at De Aar, in the Northern Cape will boost the local economy and improve the living conditions of communities. More than 100 direct jobs have already been created and a further 300 jobs are expected. The Wagons Refurbishing Facility is part of Transnet s R300 billion infrastructure plan to revamp and modernise the country s rail, pipeline and ports network which will create 588 000 new jobs. Young people in the area will also benefit from the development of a Youth Multi-Purpose Precinct. This project forms part of a number of government infrastructure projects coordinated through the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Committee.2.2. As part of government s drive to expand the capabilities of the South African manufacturing industry, to increase the country s industrial base and create the much needed jobs, an R80 million facility was launched in Epping Cape Town. This 120 MW solar PV module production facility was officially launched on 6 August 2014 by Jinko Solar, a Chinese multinational company. This is part of the roll-out of the South African Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Programme (REIPPP). The facility is expected to produce 1 300 solar panels per day, with an expected R600 million turnover per year. Since the inception of this programme, Jinko Solar has deployed over 300MW of solar PV panels, reaching approximately 30% market share.The plant, which is the newest and most modern of its type on the continent, is expected to produce 120 Megawatts by the end of the year. This is part of government s drive to expand the capabilities of the South African manufacturing industry, to increase the country s industrial base and create the much needed jobs in Epping. The Green Economy has been identified as a key focus area in the Industrial Policy Action Plan and provides significant opportunities for job creation, localisation and economic growth.2.3. Cabinet is pleased with the launch of the Renewable Energy Centre of Excellence in Upington, Northern Cape which represents another initiative to move South Africa forward. The centre is the result of strong collaboration among academia, the private sector, and government in the area of renewable energy. The centre will support research, development and innovation in the energy sector, informing and influencing policy decisions and supporting human capital development. This will contribute significantly towards expanding the Green Economy, and transforming the skills profile of the province and region. Renewable energy presents numerous exciting investment prospects, including massive job creation opportunities2.4. Cabinet welcomes the launch of the Hydrogen Fuel Cells (HFC) technology electrification project on 5 August 2014 which is the culmination of robust and productive deliberations between government and the Anglo-Ballard partnership. This project to derive power from fuel cell technology is the world's first fuel cell mini-grid electrification field trial. Of particular interest is the pivotal role of the development and deployment of this technology in localisation of the energy value chain specifically the use of fuel cell technology as an alternative generation technology. This project will deepen industrialisation of South Africa s economy and enable us to reduce the carbon intensity of its economy and contribute significantly to employment creation.3. Key Cabinet decisions3.1. Cabinet approved South Africa s initial transport sector offer under the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Trade in Services Negotiations. This sector is critical to South Africa s growth and job creation prospects, both as an intermediate input to merchandise trade and as a tradable service in its own right. Intra-regional integration of transport services can generate commercially valuable market opportunities for South African service suppliers as well as investment across the transport sectors in the region. As income is generated by exporting services within value chains, South African companies could obtain commercial benefits and simultaneously contribute to the development of the regional transport sector.3.2. Cabinet was briefed on the outcomes of the 2013 rhino census conducted in the Kruger National Park and approved the recommended strategic interventions to secure the rhino population. The Minister of Environmental Affairs will at a later stage conduct a separate media briefing on this matter.3.3. Cabinet approved the new Zimbabwean Dispensation process.

Cabinet approved that a full review be undertaken of Provincial Development Finance Institutions (PDFIs) based on the findings and recommendations from a desktop review, by National Treasury to assess current financial status and development effectiveness. The full-scale review of the PDFIs will assist to ensure their mandates are coordinated and effective in support of Government s social and economic policy objectives and also ensuring efficient allocation and use of Government resources.3.5. Cabinet welcomed the progress on the Turnaround Strategy to rebuild the Department of Public Works and the Close-out Report of the Stabilisation Phase. Cabinet is satisfied with progress recorded in turning around the department. The Minister of Public Works will conduct a separate media briefing to explain the details of this report.4. Cabinet s position on current issues4.1. Cabinet welcomes the amended Employment Equity Act which came into force on 1 August 2014. The amended Act promotes transformation, fairer labour practices and protects against unfair discrimination. It further strengthens implementation and enforcement mechanisms by, for example increasing fines for non-compliance. Cabinet calls on employers to comply with the provisions of the Act and work with government to transform the workplace. Furthermore, the Department of Labour is conducting public road shows to educate the public about employment equity and its impact.4.2. Cabinet congratulates Team South Africa on its outstanding performance during the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland which won them 13 gold, 10 silver and 17 bronze medals. South Africa achieved 7th place in the medal rankings and was the best performing African country. Cabinet calls on South Africans to honour and celebrate the achievements of our South African athletes on Friday, 8 August 2014, when open buses will be carrying the athletes from Olympic House in Johannesburg at 11h00.4.3. Cabinet also congratulates the national cricket team (Proteas) under the leadership of Test Captain Hashim Amla for winning the Test series in Sri Lanka and regaining the number one International Cricket Council World Test ranking.4.4.

SADC continues to be the primary vehicle for  South  Africa s foreign policy on regional development and integration. Pertinent issues  to be  discussed at the Summit include the Review of the Regional Indicative Strategic  Development  Plan, the SADC Vision 2050, SADC Tribunal and the Food and Nutrition  Strategy and Regional Agricultural Policy.5.2 The inaugural Mining Lekgotla will be held on 13 and 14 August 2014 at Gallagher  Estate,  Johannesburg under the theme:  Building on the contribution of mining since the  advent of  democracy: The past we acknowledge and the future we build.  The Lekgotla  allows for  strategic interaction between stakeholders in the South African mining  industry and other role  players. Cabinet urges all partners to work towards the  implementation of the Framework  Agreement for a Sustainable Mining Industry and  reaffirms that Government will monitor  compliance with the Mining Charter.5.3 The Centre for Public Service innovation will hold its 8th Public Sector Innovation  Conference on 19 and 20 August 2014 in Cape Town under the theme  Building an  Innovative State Machinery for Maximised Service Delivery Impact . Cabinet wishes  delegates fruitful deliberations as innovation in the public sector is vital to help us  achieve  Vision 2030 as outlined in the National Development Plan.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 20 August 2014,21 Aug 2014,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-20-august-2014,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-20-august-2014,"1. Implementation of key government programmesCabinet commends the launch of another Sexual Offences Court in Bethlehem, Free State by Minister Michael Masutha. This forms part of government s intervention programme in the fight against sexual violence against women, children and the vulnerable groups.These dedicated courts are equipped to provide specialised victim-support services which in turn help to improve conviction rates. Government remains resolute to strengthen the criminal justice system so as to deal decisively with the violation of the rights of women and children.Cabinet welcomes the launch by Minister Lindiwe Zulu of the Enterprise Development Academy based at the Gordon Institute of Business Science.The Academy focuses on scholarship-based education and support to micro and small business owners by helping them grow sustainably to create further employment in the long term. The Academy is part of the solution to address youth  unemployment and build a nation of entrepreneurs. It aims to provide practical and  relevant business education and leadership training to entrepreneurs, followed by a  comprehensive structure of support services.	This ensures that academic learning is applied to the business environment and that impact is achieved.	South Africa needs an entrepreneurial revolution in order to spark a shift in  direction towards entrepreneurship and SMEs that will move the country forward. Government, big business and academic institutions need to collaborate when it  comes to supporting job creation through enterprise development. In order to flourish, business creation needs an enabling environment where entrepreneurs have access to funding, best-practice tools and skills development.2. Key Cabinet decisionsCabinet approved the ratification of the signed Grand Inga Treaty between the Republic of South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) for tabling in Parliament.The Treaty provides the framework for the facilitation of power generation from Grand Inga Project and its delivery to the border between the DRC and Zambia. Ratification of the Treaty enables development of Phase I of the Project, which will provide 2 500 Megawatts of electricity to South Africa and contribute to regional integration,  energy security, access to energy and economic growth in an environmentally  sustainable manner.	The project has the potential to supply clean and affordable imported hydroelectric  power to meet the needs of the DRC, South Africa and surrounding countries. It  entails the generation of approximately 40 000 Megawatt of hydropower on the  Congo River, over seven phases. The project holds the potential to fast-track Southern African Development Community (SADC)  development; alleviate energy poverty, stimulate economic growth and facilitate  infrastructure development.The Grand Inga project will seek to harness the power potential of the Congo River, sub-Saharan Africa's greatest waterway. This represents one of the most ambitious  projects ever undertaken on the African continent, and one which will long be a resounding symbol of the rise of Africa and her people.Cabinet was briefed on the upcoming International Gender, Water and Development Conference. The conference will be hosted by the Department of Water and Sanitation, Water Research and its partners in the sector. The conference will be held from the 3 to 7 November in East London under the theme  The Untapped Connection .	The conference follows a number of ongoing dialogues that started after the International Freshwater Governance Conference that was held in November 2012. The conference will provide a platform to forge partnerships that will address the challenges faced by the sector. It will also address the roll-out of the African Ministers Council on Water Gender Strategy.3. Cabinet s Position on Current Issues	Cabinet was briefed by the Minister of Health, Mr. Aaron Motsoaledi, on developments around Ebola and interventions made by South Africa . Cabinet wishes to reiterate that no person has been found positive with the disease. The country s state of readiness and response on Ebola requires strengthen capacity in the SADC region and the rest of the continent which South Africa can offer. South Africa remains committed to provide support through screening, training and laboratory services for the SADC region. Minister Motsoaledi will give a full briefing on this issue today  at 14h30.	Cabinet welcomes the plans by the South African Reserve Bank and a consortium of investors from the financial sector to restructure African Bank Limited (ABL). This will assist to appropriately safeguard retail depositors and minimise losses for investors in ABL.	This will also ensure the country s financial sector remains strong and robust.Cabinet emphasised, the importance of the financial services sector to economic growth and highlighted that government, through the National Treasury, will continue to strengthen the sector, its oversight, and improve regulatory coordination.	Cabinet noted with concern the misinformation about the various reforms regarding retirement funds (pension and provident funds).  There is anecdotal evidence that some workers are resigning from work on fears that government will from next year prevent them from withdrawing their retirement savings when they change jobs, and that government wants to take over retirement funds.  While government wants to encourage workers to preserve their savings until retirement, no laws have changed to stop withdrawal when workers change jobs. By contrast, the various retirement reform proposals seek to:a) Encourage individuals to provide adequately for their own retirement and the needs of their dependents and to provide for retirement funding as part of the remuneration contract;b) Make retirement funding arrangements cost-efficient, prudently managed, transparent and fair; and c) Improve standards of fund governance, including standards of fund governance, including trustee knowledge and conduct, protection of members  interest, accountability and disclosure of material information to members and contributors.Cabinet wants to assure the public that people s retirement savings remain safe. There is no reason for any worker (both in the private and public sector) to resign so as to access their retirement savings. It should also be noted that those cashing out their pension or provident funds before retirement will not only get less money than they would had they preserved, but they may be taxed on early withdrawals and no longer enjoy the tax advantages.4. Upcoming eventsMinister Nathi Mthethwa will launch Heritage Month in Gauteng on 31 August under the theme:  Celebrating 20 Years of Democracy: Tell Your Story that Moves South Africa Forward .	Among the projects identified to advance the  Tell Your Story  campaign are the reburials of Nat Nakasa and Moses Kotane. Repatriations of unsung heroes provide South Africans with an opportunity to learn more about their personal struggles, the circumstances that led to them living in exile and the impact they had on the liberation of our country.	Other events include: National Book Week from 1 to 7 September under the theme:  Going Places  focusing on the power of books and how they can  figuratively  and  literally  take South Africans to places. Events are planned in all the provinces and will include reading in indigenous languages, storytelling and motivational talks, word-a-thons, poetry sessions and book debates.Also, on 3 September South Africa will commemorate the 30th Anniversary of the Vaal Uprising during which the Vaal Triangle community protested against rent increases, poor service delivery and an illegitimate, and defunct local government. The Vaal Uprising introduced a new period of sustained protest that spread to large parts of the country, prompting the apartheid authorities to declare a state of emergency.Minister Derek Hanekom will launch Tourism Month on 26 August at Maboneng Precinct, Johannesburg, under the theme:  Tourism Transforming Lives , which is derived from World Tourism Day (27 September) and focuses on the social, cultural, political and economic value of tourism to the country. South Africans are encouraged to travel within our country during Tourism Month and to familiarise themselves on the importance of tourism to the economy.National Arbor Week will be celebrated from 1 to 7 September under the theme:  Forests and People: Investing in a sustainable future . South Africans are encouraged to plant the identified trees for 2014, either the Vepris lanceolata (commonly known as: White Ironwood/ Witysterhout/ Muruvula/ Muhondwa/ umZane/ umOzana) or the Heteropyxis Natalensis Harvey (commonly known as: Lavender Tree/ Laventelboom/ iNkunzi).	The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) will, in collaboration with the Institute for Environment and Recreation Management and Total South Africa, run the National Arbor City Award competition. The purpose is to encourage Local Municipalities to green their areas of jurisdiction.	National Arbor Week and the National Arbor City Award is conducted in line with the DAFF greening strategy which defines greening as an integrated approach to the planting, care and management of all vegetation in urban and rural areas.5.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 3 September 2014,4 Sep 2014,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-3-september-2014,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-3-september-2014,"1. Implementation of Key Government Programmes1.1. Cabinet welcomes the official opening by President Zuma of the Dr Harry Surtie Hospital in Upington, Northern Cape, on 2 September 2014. This comes four days after another new hospital was opened by Minister of Health Dr Aaron Motsoaledi in Natalspruit, Gauteng. These are amongst many important milestones in government s national infrastructure programme which will see 43 hospitals and 213 clinics built over the next five years to meet the needs of the National Health Insurance system.1.2. Cabinet commends the recent arrests and seizures under Project Darling and the arrest of a gang suspected of truck hijackings. Project Darling resulted in the recovery of illegal diamonds and the seizure of R50 million in assets, 15 homes and R43 million in foreign currency.  Later this month the police will release the annual crime statistics. These figures are based on the actual number of cases reported to the Police, and will reflect successes and challenges.The publication of these figures allows us to engage in informed discussion on how to strengthen the partnerships with society around government s comprehensive anti-crime strategic interventions. For the country to be successful in fighting crime, Cabinet urges communities to play their part in reporting crime and supporting community safety forums as the fight against crime calls for community-wide effort.Government condemns the brutal attacks we have seen against members of the South African Police Services while on duty. On Sunday, 7 September 2014 government will honour and pay tribute to these police officers who lost their lives in the line of duty. Cabinet invites the nation to pay tribute these officers who died while trying to enforce the law.1.3. Cabinet welcomes the announcement of a R2 billion aqua-farming facility at the Coega Industrial Development Zone in the Eastern Cape which will allocate 80 hectares to abalone farming by 2020 and create about 2 080 permanent jobs. This project is part of Operation Phakisa that seeks to unlock the economic potential of South Africa s oceans. The project has a potential to contribute in the economy by about R177 billion and create up to one million jobs by 2033. Cabinet encourages more investors to partner with Government in new economic growth opportunities.1.4. Cabinet appreciates the presence of a team of South African medical experts in the West African States of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia who are helping to fight the spread of the Ebola Virus. This team of highly trained specialists is equipped with a mobile laboratory and has been there for the past two (2) weeks assisting to diagnose the disease throughout that Region. 1.5. Cabinet welcomes the launch of Phase 1A, project named the Pongolapoort Bulk Water Supply. The venture estimated to cost R1,5 billion will result in the supply of potable water and the installation of bulk water and reticulation networks to 134 864 people within 16 200 households. The project will bring water to the community of Jozini Local Municipality, in KwaZulu-Natal.2. Key Cabinet decisions2.1. Cabinet approved the release of the draft Integrated Urban Development Framework for consultation with key stakeholders and for intergovernmental interaction. This will seek consensus on the agenda for urban transformation in South Africa. The Framework responds to President Jacob Zuma s calls for a national integrated urban development framework to deal with the legacy of apartheid spatial patterns and to assist municipalities to effectively manage rapid urbanisation. The vision of the Framework is to promote livable, inclusive and resilient cities and towns. It will address the legacy of spatial separation on racial and economic bases and create a more integrated, cohesive cities and towns.2.2. Cabinet approved South Africa s National Report on Housing and Urban Development which will be presented to the United Nation s Conference (HABITAT III) in 2016. The first UN preparatory conference will be held on the 17th and 18th September 2014. This report is expected to generate a  New Urban Agenda  for the 21st century to deal with challenges confronting developing and developed countries, acknowledging the increasingly important role of cities in global issues such as climate change, disasters, economic development and human rights. Preparations for Habitat III come at a time when South Africa is developing its Integrated Urban Policy Framework and commencing preparations for our Green paper on Human Settlements.2.3. Cabinet approved the establishment of the State Property Management Agency which will oversee the management of the government property. This will be a Government Component entity under the custodianship of the Minister of Public Works. Minister Nxesi will expand more on this issue.2.4. Cabinet approved the amended Policy on the appointment of Insolvency Practitioners which will be published by notice in the Government Gazette. The focus of the Policy is to promote consistency, fairness, transparency and the achievement of equality for persons previously disadvantaged by unfair discrimination. The biggest change that is being introduced by the amendment is the removal of the system called Requisition with a view to advance transformation. The policy will only apply to appointments made in terms of the Insolvency Act, the Companies Act and the Close Corporations Act.3. Bills3.1. Cabinet approved that the Expropriation Bill, 2014 be tabled in Parliament. The Expropriation Act, 1975 predates the Constitution, 1996 making it imperative to align the overarching legislation governing the expropriation of property to the values and provisions of the Constitution. Minister Nxesi will expand more on this issue.4. Cabinet s position on current issues4.1. Cabinet is encouraged by the positive economic growth recorded in the second quarter of the year in spite of difficult economic conditions in the country and abroad. The pace of economic expansion remains too weak to address our challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment. Government is fast-tracking the implementation of the National Development Plan to address our structural challenges, increase permanently our growth potential and create jobs for our people. In this regard, our investment in infrastructure   electricity, transport, water, roads, schools and hospitals - builds a platform for faster, more inclusive economic growth.The annual volume of capital investment by public enterprises has increased by more than 260 per cent in real terms over the past 10 years. Local government s annual infrastructure spending has doubled in real terms since the late 1990s. The public sector has invested over R1 trillion in infrastructure since 2009/10. We expect that growth in the second half of the year will be stronger as the mining and manufacturing sectors recover. And government will continue to work with business and labour to create an environment, which is conducive to investment and economic growth.4.2. Cabinet condemn the recent acts and statements that incite violence which go against our constitutional values and threaten to erode the gains that we have made as a country. The recent spate of the vandalising of buses in the Western Cape is also condemned in the strongest terms.Cabinet commends parents who took it upon themselves to ensure that children go back to school in the Northern Cape. Cabinet thanks parents for intervening on the future of their children and appeals that the interest of the children should never again be compromised or be used to bargain for community issues. Cabinet encourages South Africans to safeguard the country s reputation on its ability to engage in constructive dialogue and to resolve issues irrespective of who is involved so as to move South Africa Forward.4.3. Cabinet welcomes the decisive actions by the SADC organ on Peace and Security in the recent Lesotho political crises and reiterates its unconditional support for the SADC position that rejects all attempts to unconstitutional changes of government. Cabinet therefore calls on all role players to work together to restore democratic order in Lesotho and fully implement the Road Map agreed with the SADC organ.4.4. Cabinet noted the resignation of the Chairperson of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), Advocate Pansy Tlakula. Her resignation comes against the backdrop of a successful 2014 General Election which she managed. She contributed immensely to ensure our democracy remains strong. Cabinet express its gratitude to the contribution made by Adv Tlakula and extends its thanks for her selfless contribution to our democracy and wishes her well.4.5. Cabinet welcomes the judgment by the Constitutional Court which is an affirmation that the government s affirmative action policy is correct. Government remains steadfast in its programme to redress the social inequalities especially within the working environment. This ruling also confirms that indeed affirmative action together with other employment equity laws promote transformation and empower the previously disadvantaged.5. Upcoming events5.1. The Department of Basic Education will conduct the fourth Annual National Assessments (ANA) from 16 to 19 September 2014 to track progress of learning outcomes among Grades 1 - 6 and Grade 9 as part of the efforts to improve the quality of education. This year (2014) the Department of Basic Education will also pilot the assessment of a sample of learners in Grades 7 and 8 and the decision on this assessment will be taken in 2015.The ANA generates standardised evidence to monitor the success of various Government interventions to improve literacy and numeracy among learners and also enables teachers to identify areas that require additional support. Cabinet encourages parents and guardians to support their children and to ensure that the results are used to address any development areas. The ANA timetable and resources for 2014 is on available on: www.education.gov.za5.2. The Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform Gugile Nkwinti will host the 2014 Land Tenure Summit at Birchwood Hotel and OR Tambo Conference Centre, Boksburg from 4 to 6 September 2014. The Summit will focus on measures to reverse the country s colonial and apartheid past which caused more than 75 per cent of the black population to be landless, property-less, unskilled and without secure tenure rights. Cabinet urges stakeholders to work with Government and to implement commitments to address the issue of secure tenure rights.5.3. The Public Service Month programme from 1 to 30 September 2014 under the theme  Reinventing the Way Public Servants Work: Batho Pele  Putting People First , will focus on intensifying especially frontline service delivery. Cabinet calls on South Africans to honour exceptional public servants or Government institutions by nominating them for the National Batho Pele Excellence Awards before the closing date of 30 September 2014.5.4. Heritage month is celebrated from 1   30 September 2014 under the theme  Celebrating 20 Years of Democracy: Tell Your Story that Moves South Africa Forward . Cabinet encourages South Africans to celebrate our rich natural and cultural heritage, diverse beliefs and traditions as a people united in pursuit of a shared identity. This year s Heritage Month takes place against the backdrop of our 20 Years of Freedom celebrations which also reinforces our collective memory of the struggle towards promoting a national identity.Cabinet encourages South Africans, in particular the youth to embrace South Africa's common heritage and use our diverse cultural heritage to foster nation building, inclusive citizenship and social cohesion.

Transfer of Department of Health Shares in Biovac CompanyCabinet approved the transfer of Department of Health s shares in the Biological and Vaccines Institute (Biovac) of Southern Africa to the Department of Science and Technology.Biovac is a public-private partnership between the South African Government and the Biovac Consortium. The South African Government shares comprised of 12, 5% owned by Department of Science and Technology and 35% owned by Department of Health. The transfer of shares is a response to the concerns raised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations Children s Fund (UNICEF) that Department of Health in the current arrangement may be conflicted as it acted as a shareholder and a buyer.The WHO requires the regulatory authority (in this case the Medicines Control Council which is part of the Department of Health) and its oversight role be separated from that of any manufacturer of medicine   in this, Biovac.  The transfer of Department of Health shares to Science and Technology, will enable Biovac to export its manufactured products to countries benefitting from the WHO and UNICEF vaccines programmes.Biovac is a company that supplies high-quality, safe and effective vaccines to the public sector, and is a leading supplier of paediatrics vaccines to government's Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI). Through the Department of Science and Technology, government will now own 47,5% of Biovac shares while 52.5 % will be held by the Biovac Consortium.2.2. EskomAs announced this past weekend, Cabinet has approved a package of measures to secure the sustainability of the electricity industry, strengthen Eskom s finances, and ensure that the energy security of the country is maintained.All of this will have to be done in a manner that does not add further pressure to the nation s finances. At the same time, government would like to ensure that poor households are cushioned as far as fiscal resources allow from the impact of the tariff adjustment.The Cabinet decision is based on the recommendations of an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) which reviewed an extensive set of options available to ensure energy security. The IMC will continue to monitor the industry closely.Details of the package can be accessed via the National Treasury website.In summary the package consists of, among others, an injection by government of additional equity into Eskom to help the utility strengthen its balance sheet, enabling it to borrow more from financial markets. To ensure that government s financial resources are not strained, the equity injection will be funded by leveraging non-strategic government assets. Further details in this regard will be provided when the Minister of Finance tables the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) on 22 October.Other elements of the package include: a strong improvement in Eskom s operational efficiencies which will reduce costs; a R50 billion increase in debt raised by Eskom which will be supported by the existing government guarantees; government support for Eskom s application to NERSA for an adjustment to the tariff, which is in line with normal regulatory processes; demand management measures; refinements to energy policy; and the expansion of the independent power producer programme.In terms of cushioning poor households, government will strengthen oversight of the free basic electricity grant. This will ensure that allocations are used effectively as well as to encourage municipalities to improve the efficiency with which they maintain their networks and supply power to consumers. These measures are necessary for South Africa to raise economic growth to a rate which is sufficient to create more jobs, reduce poverty and inequality.2.3. Transfer of administrative functions to the Office of Chief JusticeCabinet was briefed on the commencement of the initial phase of the transfer of administrative functions and staff relating to the Superior Courts from the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development to the Office of the Chief Justice. This gives effect to the Constitution Seventeenth Amendment Act, 2012 and the Superior Courts Act, Act No. 10 of 2013. The Superior Courts Act enhances the administration of the magistracy by placing magistrates in every Division of the High Court under the control of the Judge President of the Division concerned. The Act assigns powers and functions to the Office of the Chief Justice which was established as a separate state institution equivalent to a department by a Presidential Proclamation in 2010. This affirms the Government s commitment to the independence of the Judiciary as espoused in our Constitution.2.4. Establishment of project management office for Presidential Infrastructure championingCabinet approved the establishment of the Project Management Office for African Union Presidential Infrastructure Championing Initiative which is led by President Zuma. This is an African-driven infrastructure programme meant to champion cross boarder infrastructure projects that will unlock the economic potential of the continent and provide development opportunities for communities, cities and regions.Cabinet approved the establishment of the Presidential Infrastructure Championing Initiative Project Management Office with the support of relevant government departments. The Project Management Office will be supported by the establishment of an Inter-Ministerial Committee on AU Presidential Infrastructure Championing Initiative in South Africa. The Committee will be chaired by the Minister in the Presidency for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation.2.5. Establishment of Public Service pool of legal and labour relation specialistCabinet approved the establishment of an internal Public Service pool of legal and labour relations specialists to deal with the backlog of pending precautionary suspension cases in the public service. The intervention aims to get the Public Service to operate more efficiently and effectively by reducing the period for completing disciplinary processes, especially where personnel are suspended on full pay.Furthermore, this initiative ensures proper management of discipline by institutionalising the maximum period of 3 months (90 days) to finalise cases. The legal and labour relations specialists  pool will comprise Public Service officials who are experts in this field, including investigators, prosecutors and presiding officers to ensure that the full labour relations value chain is optimal.3. Bills3.1. Cabinet approved the tabling in Parliament of Disaster Management Amendment Bill, 2002 (Act No. 57 of 2002). The Disaster Management Act No. 57 of 2002 sets out an integrated and coordinated approach to disaster management and disaster risk reduction across all spheres of government and the involvement of all relevant stakeholders.4.

Statement of Cabinet meeting of 22 October 2014,23 Oct 2014,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-22-october,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-22-october,"Key Cabinet decisions1.1 Cabinet approved the publication of the draft National Learner Transport Policy for public comments in the Government Gazette for 21 days.The policy improves access to quality education by providing safe, decent, effective, integrated and sustainable learner transport, especially in rural communities where transportation challenges hinder access to education.The policy addresses spatial challenges and re-organisation of operations which impact on the quality of public transport. It also provides for an integrated planning system and uniform standards of management.Implementation of this policy will provide a safe and secure transport environment for learners through cooperation and collaboration with law enforcement authorities.1.2 Cabinet approved the Directive on Compulsory Development, Mandatory Training Days and Minimum Entry Requirements to the levels of Senior Management Service as determined in terms of Section 3(2) of the Public Service Act, 1994.This promotes skills development so as to respond to the National Development Plan objective of building a capable and developmental state for the benefit of improved service delivery.The directive is a long-term skills development strategy that will enhance the quality of human resources which is critical to government s capacity to deliver on its mandate.All departments in the Public Service will be required to adopt a consistent approach to promote relevant and mandatory skills development within the Senior Management Service.1.3 Cabinet approved for the Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation to present the draft Discussion Document on Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Principles and Approach to Parliament s Portfolio Committee on Public Service Administration and Planning Monitoring and Evaluation.The document proposes a set of basic principles and an approach to Performance Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) that is intended to result in continuous improvement in government performance and increased accountability. Its key objective is to build consensus on the objectives of M&E, and how it should be implemented.This contributes to the implementation of the National Development Plan (NDP) in relation to building a capable and developmental state as well as promoting an active citizenry and strong leadership. M&E competencies are part of the core managerial competencies that are required for a capable and developmental state.1.4 Cabinet approved South Africa s negotiating positions for Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS COP11) which will be held in Quinto, Ecuador, from 4 to 9 November 2014.South Africa s active participation in addressing challenges of climate change and the conservation of nature and associated species is based on the principle of sustainable development and environmental sustainability, and is in line with the requirements of Section 24 of the Bill of Rights.1.5 Cabinet approved the negotiating mandate that will serve as the basis for South Africa s engagement at the 20th session of the Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 20), and the 10th Conference of Parties serving as the meeting of Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 10), from 1 to 12 December 2014, in Lima Peru.South Africa s position is in line with the country s national interest, and the implications for South Africa s further engagement in the international climate change negotiations as outlined in the National Development Plan.1.6 Cabinet approved a submission of the Cape Town Agreement of 2012 on the implementation of the provisions of the Torremolinos Protocol of 1993 relating to the International Convention for the Safety of Fishing Vessels, 1977 for ratification by Parliament.                                                                  The Torremolinos Convention and its Protocol of 1993 lay down safety standards, such as life-saving appliances, radio communication, fire protection, machinery and electrical installations, as well as specific requirements for seagoing fishing vessels of 24 metres and longer.This binding international safety regime will contribute to improving safety standards in order to reduce the number of fatalities at sea, estimated at 24 000 annually worldwide. South Africa s fishing vessels will be subject to the provisions of the protocol when in the waters of a State party to the 1993 Torremolinos protocol.This is in line with Operation Phakisa s objectives of developing an institutional framework for the management of South Africa s ocean space, improving the protection of South Africa s oceans, particularly around critically endangered ecosystems, and addressing the skills gap, amongst others.1.7 Cabinet approved for South Africa to accede to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch-keeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel, 1995 (STCW-F).This is the first attempt to establish international mandatory training standards for the crews of seagoing fishing vessels of 24 metres or more in length. This will improve the safety of life and property at sea, as well as to prevent pollution of the marine environment by the fishing industry.In the past, extended periods of sea service were seen as the way to acquire experience and appropriate skills. This system of on-the-job training has not produced a quality outcome for the skills of the crew.The new system is built around a combination of reduced experiential training with upgraded and more structured education for enhancing knowledge. This will make it possible for fishers to progress over time from small vessels to large fishing vessels and eventually internationally trading vessels.1.8 Cabinet approved for the following 2015 commemorative coin designs by the South African Mint Company, to be promulgated in a Government Gazette.    The Protea Coin Series:  The Life of a Legend: NR Mandela     The Natura Coin Series:  Nocturnal Hunters   The Black Backed Jackal     R1 Gold Coin Series:  South African Reptiles   The Nile crocodile     R2 Gold Coin Series:  UNESCO Project: Man and Biosphere     Crown and Tickey Silver Coin Series:  Trains of South Africa ; and    The Sterling Silver Coin Series:  Marine Protected Areas of South Africa 1.9 Cabinet was briefed on the Rationalisation of Magisterial Districts and Areas of Jurisdiction of the Divisions and Local Seats of the High Court of South Africa.The rationalisation of courts project reverses the legacy of inequality and injustice. It establishes a blueprint which will guide all affected departments, law enforcement agencies and justice institutions to align their operations accordingly.Previously marginalised communities living in the former homelands, self-governing states and rural villages will now benefit from the outcomes of the rationalisation process. They will be able to access courts at reduced costs.In providing access to justice, it is necessary to rationalise the old apartheid-drawn areas of jurisdiction of all the courts, including their composition and structure. The rationalisation process ensures that there is an equitable distribution of the courts in the country, to enhance access to courts, which is a fundamental human right enshrined in Section 34 of the Bill of Right in the Constitution.2. Bills2.1 Cabinet approved the introduction of the Maintenance Amendment Bill, 2014 in Parliament.The Bill amends the Maintenance Act, 1998 (Act 99 of 1998) to improve the maintenance system and enhance access to justice for women and children.The amendments alleviate the challenges, legal and administrative, experienced by maintenance beneficiaries, who are mostly women and children.This links directly to the key targets of the National Development Plan on economic transformation and social protection.Some of the provisions of the Amendment Bill include: preventing maintenance defaulters from continuing to receive credit while they owe maintenance, placing an obligation on mobile cellular operators to provide maintenance courts with contact particulars of would-be respondents and maintenance defaulters if the court is satisfied that all reasonable efforts to locate their whereabouts have proven fruitless, and making a person against whom a maintenance order has been made, pay maintenance arrears.2.2 Cabinet approved the submission of the Agr ment South Africa Bill and the Memorandum on the Objects of the Bill to Parliament.The establishment of Agr ment South Africa, as proposed in the Agr ment South Africa Bill, 2014 will contribute to the creation of a dynamic and innovative construction sector that will positively impact on job creation while contributing to Government s infrastructure plans.The value-add would be wide ranging from research to innovation, increased manufacturing activities, job creation and poverty alleviation.2.3 Cabinet approved the introduction of the draft Auditing Profession Amendment Bill in Parliament.The Amendment Bill proposes amendments to the Auditing Profession Act, 2005, to regulate candidate auditors and to update references to the Companies Act, 1973 so as to align the Auditing Profession Act with the Companies Act 2008 (Act No. 71 of 2008).The aim is to bring aspiring auditors (candidate auditors), before registration, under the Auditing Profession Act, 2005 so that they are regulated by the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors, in the same way that registered auditors are regulated, and to make significant amendments required by the Companies Act 2008. This will also protect the public in the work done by a candidate auditor.2.4 Cabinet approved the introduction of the Defence Laws Repeal and Amendment Bill, 2014 in Parliament.These seek to repeal and amend certain defence laws that are deemed to be obsolete and redundant as identified by the South African Law Reform Commission.The Commission was instructed to conduct an audit of all South African legislation in order to advise on the repeal of obsolete, unnecessary or unconstitutional provisions. The Bill aims to fulfill this task within the defence environment.The Bill proposes the repeal of 16 defence laws that are obsolete and further proposes the amendment of one Act, which does not comply with Section 9 of the Constitution (equality clause). This will bring the defence laws in line with the current constitutional ethos by eliminating discriminatory provisions from the statue book.3. Implementation of Key Government Programmes3.1 Cabinet joins South Africans in the celebration of Media Freedom Day on the 19th of  October 2014 when President Jacob Zuma hosted veteran journalists and editors as part of celebrating 20 years of press freedom in South Africa.  Media Freedom Day is a celebration of freedom of expression and freedom of the media which is guaranteed in our constitution.3.2 President Zuma, accompanied by Cabinet members, the Premier of KwaZulu-Natal and Provincial MECs conducted a successful Presidential Imbizo in Msunduzi and uMgungundlovu Municipalities on 30 September 2014.As part of ongoing and direct communication with South African communities, President Jacob Zuma will conduct a Presidential Siyahlola in Giyani, Limpopo, on 31 October 2014.3.3 Cabinet welcomes the progress report on the implementation of the Framework Agreement for a Sustainable Mining Industry presented at the recent Mining Sector National Consultative forum.The forum reflects all stakeholders  collective commitment to the future of mining in South Africa, and to the creation and maintenance of an equitable balance between socio-economic imperatives and investment objectives.Cabinet welcomes stakeholders  recommitment to the Framework Agreement for a Sustainable Mining Industry and to finding lasting solutions to challenges facing the industry.3.4 Cabinet welcomes President Jacob Zuma s announcement on the progress made through Operation Phakisa to unlock the economic potential of South Africa s oceans in a sustainable manner.The delivery plan by President Jacob Zuma moves us closer to realising the benefits of the ocean economy, which can contribute R177 billion to our gross domestic product and create just over 1 million jobs.The second project of Operation Phakisa began on 13 October 2014 and will focus on effective clinics in our health system. Work streams will over a six-week period explore the sector and develop delivery plans which will be released to the public once completed.3.5 Cabinet received the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS), which provides a summary of the expenditure framework within which national and provincial budgets are being prepared.Cabinet welcomes the measures announced in the MTBPS to curb spending in the Public Service.Cabinet reassures South Africans that even in this tough economic climate government will continue to fund its social programmes, infrastructure investments and incentives to support important industries.4. Cabinet s Position on Current Issues4.1 Cabinet welcomes measures put in place by the Department of Energy to improve the country s energy security, meet the needs of the economy and create much-needed jobs. The signing of nuclear intergovernmental relations agreements is a step in the right direction to secure the country s energy needs.The signed agreements add to the pool of nuclear suppliers from which the country can choose for its nuclear procurement programme and mark another milestone in the country s prioritisation of energy security.This process moves the country a step closer to graduating from the existing nuclear energy plant in Koeberg to a more comprehensive, self-sufficient nuclear industry which is expected to contribute 9.6 GW of electricity to the national grid.The National Development Plan commits the country to explore all available energy options to secure our future energy supply. Cabinet is confident that South Africa s energy mix which   includes coal, solar, wind, hydro, gas and nuclear energy   will ensure a reliable source of power to meet the country s growth needs, allow for a balance between energy sources and help us reach our carbon-reduction targets.4.2 Cabinet welcomes and congratulates all parties for successfully reconvening the Lesotho Parliament last week in line with the Maseru Facilitation Declaration facilitated by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa.4.3 Cabinet reiterates that South Africa has put in place the necessary measures to prevent Ebola from spreading to the country.Surveillance at all ports of entry has been strengthened to identify viral haemorrhagic fevers, in particular Ebola. Government has also established a national response team in case of an outbreak and 11 hospitals are on standby as Ebola treatment centres.Cabinet supports the efforts by the World Health Organisation in establishing Ebola treatment centres and strengthening capacity for laboratory testing, contact tracing, social mobilisation, safe burials and non-Ebola health care in West Africa.Cabinet also appeals to individuals and business worldwide to contribute to the Ebola Response Fund which was established to assist all affected West African countries in their fight against this devastating disease.4.4 Cabinet welcomes the arrest of six individuals linked to the cable theft which resulted in water outages in parts of Gauteng. The individuals were part of a syndicate that police reportedly smashed with these arrests. Cabinet expressed the view that the cable theft and related activities - manhole covers, bridge rails, electricity pylons, fences, etc. are tantamount to sabotage of the country s infrastructure programme. Government will ensure that perpetrators convicted either of theft on receipt of stolen cables are subject to the maximum penalties provided by the law. Government is seized with this issue and will not hesitate act more effectively to combat this scourge.4.5 Trade and Investment South Africa (TISA), a division of the Department of Trade and Industry (the dti), last week received an award at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development s World Investment Forum in Geneva for the promotion of sustainable investment. This was for the work undertaken by TISA in supporting the establishment of Unilever s Indonesia plant in Ethekwini, which was opened by the Minister of Trade and Industry during South Africa s hosting of the COP 17.4.6 Cabinet received an update on the collapse of the building in Nigeria. A separate statement will be delivered after this briefing.5.

The visit will deepen our existing strong bilateral relationship with Burundi and advance intra-trade on the continent.5.3 The Department of Water and Sanitation, in partnership with the African Ministers' Council on Water (AMCOW), the Water Research Commission of South Africa, SADC and Women for Water Partnership, will host the Gender, Water and Development Conference in East London from 3 to 7 November 2014 under the theme:  Gender, Water & Development   the untapped connection .The agenda of the conference will be set by the AMCOW Policy and Strategy for Mainstreaming Gender in the Water Sector in Africa, which has seven objectives focussing on policy, resources, strategic research, capacity building, cooperation and monitoring and evaluation, to reach the overall objective of gender equality in water policy.5.4 Cabinet wishes all learners well as they prepare for their year-end examinations. These exams are a useful barometer of our education interventions such as Annual National Assessments (ANA) and the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS).Cabinet welcomes Umalusi s assurance that the country is ready to conduct the National Senior Certificate examinations between 27 October and 28 November 2014.All parents, guardians and communities are encouraged to support learners as they prepare for their examinations.Cabinet further wishes the matric class of 2014 well in their forthcoming examinations. Cabinet also urges parents and guardians to support the 2015 School Governing Body Election from 6 to 28 March 2015 either by standing as candidates or by voting.5.5 Cabinet calls on all South Africans to support National Disability Rights Awareness Month between 3 November and 3 December 2014 under the theme:  Celebrating 20 years of the rights of persons with disabilities in our Democracy .Since 1994 we have made major strides in advancing the rights and quality of life of people with disabilities through legislation, policies and social interventions.

Key Cabinet decisions 1.1. Cabinet approved the 16 Days of Activism Campaign under the theme  Count Me In: Together Moving a Non-Violent South Africa forward .This year (2014) marks the 16th anniversary of this campaign which aims to continue generating awareness on the protection of women and children with more focus on mobilising men and partnering with them to also assist in the fight against this scourge of violence on women and children.The campaign will be launched on 25th of November until the 10th December 2014. Beyond the 16 Days of Activism, there is a year-long programme which will monitor and evaluate the extent to which lives have improved through the implementation of laws and programmes aimed at eradicating violence against women and children.1.2. Cabinet was briefed on the progress report on developing a model for Citizen-based Monitoring.A pilot project focuses on building the capacity of government to elicit the views of citizens as part of its monitoring mechanism. The pilot will use existing programmes such as the Community Works Programme and the Community Development Workers programme to upscale the citizen-based monitoring over the Medium Term Strategic Framework period.The pilot focused on the following key sector departments: South African Police Service, the Departments of Health and Social Development and the South African Social Security Agency. This will be extended to other sectors over the course of the Medium Term Strategic Framework period.1.3. Cabinet approved the deployment of 140 members of the South African Police Service (SAPS) to the Kingdom of Lesotho for the initial period of ninety days; with an extension should it be required.Immediate SADC intervention was required in the Kingdom of Lesotho following the escalating tensions and the subsequent deterioration of political and security situation in August 2014. The SADC intervention is aimed in particular at the attainment of long term political and security stability.The SADC Troika on Politics, Defence and Security of which South Africa is the Chair requested the South African government to support the implementation of the Roadmap of the kingdom of Lesotho.The deployment of 140 SAPS members commenced on 2 September 2014 and is expected to end on 30 November 2014, should no extension be required. South Africa deployed the Police in Lesotho in terms of the South African Police Service Act 1995; (Act No. 68 of 1995) provides that the National Commissioner of the South African Police Service may deploy police members outside the borders of the Republic, with the permission of the Minister. Since the members will be deployed under the SADC mandate there will be no Memorandum of Understanding between South Africa and the Government of Lesotho.1.4. Cabinet approved the negotiating mandate for the South African delegation attending the Joint 10th Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Vienna Convention and the 26th Meeting of the Parties (MOP) to the Montreal Protocol on Substance that Deplete the Ozone Layer (COP10-MOP26), 17-21 November 2014 in Paris, France.The Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol were established by the United Nations Environment Programme with the objective of protecting the Ozone layer. The protection of the environment for present and future generations is a priority and also the protection of the ozone layer. The primary aim is to work towards environmentally sound management of chemicals in a sustainable manner.1.5. Cabinet approved the establishment of the Transport Sector Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Charter Council to monitor and evaluate implementation of the Black Economic Empowerment targets.2. Implementation of Key Government Programmes2.1. Cabinet welcomed President Jacob Zuma s Siyahlola Service Delivery Monitoring Visit to the Mopani District, Giyani in Limpopo Province. Service delivery programmes resulted in water being provided to 55 villages in this district and the refurbishment of the Giyani Water Treatment Works, which increased capacity to an additional 6.7 Megalitres per day. This provision of water will improve sanitation and consequently have a positive impact on the health and wellbeing of residents.2.2. Cabinet welcomed the initiative led by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa that brought together the constituency of National Economic Development and Labour Council on 4 November 2014 to find amicable solutions to workplace conflict at the Labour Relations Indaba.The delegates attending the Indaba declared as follows,  that constituencies recognise the challenges of unemployment, poverty and inequality facing the South African economy and society. Notwithstanding any challenges which may constrain current social dialogue, the Nedlac constituencies recognise Nedlac as the key structure under which social dialogue is conducted, and therefore the custodian of any processes that may follow the Labour Relations Indaba (Indaba).The indaba social partners that it will be a launch of a process of engagement, through task teams, that will identify ways of addressing the key challenges considered during the Indaba. A detailed roadmap of the process will be developed within two months of the Indaba, and the deliberations will begin during January 2015.Cabinet is confident that such engagements between government, business, labour and civil society will contribute to higher economic growth.2.3. Cabinet welcomed the Deputy President Cyril Ramphosa s intervention in the reported eviction in the Western Cape farms. His meetings with farmers and workers have yielded fruits in this regard.2.4. Cabinet welcomed the successful Ministerial working visit to the United Kingdom led by Minister in the Presidency, Jeff Radebe, from 27 to 28 October 2014. The programme, which included the innovaBRICS Conference and Chatham House in London, provided government and South African business leaders with an opportunity to promote South Africa as a prime business destination.2.5. Cabinet welcomed the Auditor General briefing on the audit outcomes of the National and provincial government 2013/14 as this is part of government s efforts to ensure good governance. Government will take steps for remedial action in cases where weaknesses were identified by the audit.3. Cabinet s Position on Current Issues3.1. Cabinet welcomed the World Bank Report (South African Economic Update s 6th report, with a special focus on fiscal policy and redistribution) which indicated that South Africa had achieved a lot in the last 20 years. The South Africa Economic Update, released on Tuesday, 04 November 2014, found that SA s fiscal policies are cutting the rates of poverty and inequality, and that tax and social benefits are effectively redistributing income from rich to poor. The report showed that fiscal policy is very progressive in South Africa as it benefits the poor. The report also indicates that these fiscal policies have lifted 3.6 million people out of poverty in 2010/11.3.2. Cabinet has noted the current challenges with electricity that are caused by technical and infrastructure problems in some of our power stations. Cabinet therefore calls on all South Africans to assist in saving electricity as the country's power grid is under severe strain. Cabinet would like to reassure South Africans that everything is being done to address these problems.3.3. Cabinet noted the Quarterly Labour Force Survey which showed official unemployment during the third quarter of this year at 25.4 per cent up from 24.7 per cent in the same period a year ago highlighting the need for optimal economic performance so that we are able to address the triple challenge of unemployment, poverty and inequality.Cabinet reassures South Africans that addressing unemployment remains government s top priority. While Public Employment Programmes continue to yield results, Cabinet calls on all the social partners to work with government to intensify efforts to create jobs and finding short and long term solutions to the challenge of unemployment.3.4. Cabinet welcomed the recent rating upgrade of the Industrial Development Cooperation (IDC) by the Fitch Ratings Agency.3.5. Cabinet conveys its condolences to the government and people of the Republic of Zambia following the passing of President Michael Chilufya Sata.3.6. Cabinet is saddened by the death of four of the country s sporting stars and conveys its condolences to the families and friends of professional boxer Phindile Mwelase, Olympic gold medallist Mbulaeni Mulaudzi, former Springbok player Tinus Linee and Bafana Bafana captain Senzo Meyiwa. Public support for the memorial services and the heartfelt outpouring of emotion united us in our grief as we remember our sporting heroes.3.7. Cabinet also applauded the speedy arrest of one suspect by the South African Police Service last week in the murder of Bafana Bafana captain Senzo Meyiwa and also urge communities to continue working with the Police to bring all suspects to book.Cabinet welcomes the nine life sentences meted out to Ntokozo Hadebe for his heinous crimes against three young girls in Diepsloot, Johannesburg, as well as the 315-year prison sentence given to Mhlonishwa Elias Mathebula for his reign of terror in Kwazulu Natal. From 2008 - 2013, Mathebula accosted females on the South Coast, mainly Umzinto, Hibberdene, Dududu and Msinsi by stalking and raping 18 victims, aged from 14 to 40.These sentences send a strong message to criminals that acts of criminality will not be tolerated.3.8. Cabinet assures South Africans that government is doing everything possible to keep everyone safe and calls on communities to assist the police by reporting criminal activities in their area.3.9. Cabinet reiterates that the health and port authorities remain on high alert to identify and contain Ebola. To date approximately 525 health and laboratory workers at 13 hospitals (including the 11 designated facilities) and approximately 270 officials at nine high risk ports of entry were trained to deal with any eventualities.3.10. Cabinet congratulates H.E. President Lt. General Ian Khama Seretse Khama, leader of the Botswana Democratic Party, on his re-election as President of the Republic of Botswana, following the successful elections on 24 October 2014.3.11. Cabinet congratulates H.E. Ms Dilma Rousseff, of the Workers Party on her successful re-election as President of the Federative Republic of Brazil following the successful elections in 26 October 2014.3.12. Cabinet wishes the new Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Lesetja Kganyago well as he assumes his position on 9 November 2014. Cabinet also expresses its gratitude to the outgoing Governor Gill Marcus for steering monetary policy well in difficult economic times.3.13. Cabinet congratulates Chad Le Clos as one of the two overall winners of the FINA (F d ration Internationale de Natation) Swimming World Cup Series which ended in Singapore. 4. Upcoming events4.1. President Jacob Zuma will attend the G20 Summit in Brisbane, Australia, from 15 to 16 November 2014. As the only African country represented in the G20, South Africa s membership provides an opportunity to influence key international policies that could have an impact on our economy, the region and the continent.4.2. The SADC facilitator and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will pay a visit to Lesotho from 5   6 November as part of efforts to consolidate peace and security in the Kingdom. This follows the recent signing of the Maseru facilitation declaration and the Maseru security accord which lays a basis for the return of Lesotho to political normalcy and the stabilisation of the security situation in the country. 4.3. Cabinet welcomes the launch of the Mashunka and Ngubo Bridge, the Tugela Ferry Irrigation Scheme and uMsinga auction facilities in Msinga, KwaZulu-Natal, on 8 November 2014 by the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform.The Tugela Ferry Irrigation Scheme will assist 1 716 small-holder farmers and the uMsinga livestock sales yard will create employment opportunities. The bridge over the Tugela River will better connect the Mashunka and Ngubo communities to services and economic opportunities. These rural infrastructure and development projects are in line with government s aim to build vibrant, equitable and sustainable rural communities. 4.4. The Department of Environmental Affairs, together with the Inter-Governmental Committee on Climate Change, will hold a conference on South Africa s National Climate Change Response between 10 and 13 November 2014 at the Gallagher Convention Centre, Midrand, under the theme:  South Africa is transitioning to a lower carbon and climate resilient economy and society.  To this effect, Cabinet reiterated South Africa s commitment to develop a lower carbon economy and build on the successes of the Durban climate change conference 5.

Implementation of Key Government Programmes1.1. Cabinet welcomes the launch of Operation Phakisa 2: Scaling up Ideal Clinic Realisation and Maintenance Programme. This follows Operation Phakisa 1 which focused on unlocking the economic potential of South Africa's oceans. Operation Phakisa 2 seeks to improve the quality of care provided in 3 500 Primary Health Care facilities, consisting of government clinics and Community Health Centres. The expected outcomes entails transformation of the existing clinics and Community Health Centres into centres of excellence, which will be used by all South Africans, due to the enhanced quality of services they will provide.1.2. Cabinet congratulates the winners of the Batho Pele Excellence Awards, which was held on 14 November 2014. These awards entrench professionalism and recognise excellence in the public service.1.3. Cabinet noted that Minister of Sport and Recreation, Minister Fikile Mbalula will host the 2014 South African Sport Awards at the Sandton Convention Centre on 30 November 2014. Cabinet encourages sport loving South Africans to be part the South African Sports Awards by voting for the Sports Star of the Year. Information is available on www.sasportsawards.com.1.4. Cabinet congratulates our national sporting teams Bafana Bafana, the Springboks and the Proteas for flying the flag high with their strong performances over the weekend and making South Africa proud. The naming of Mr AB de Villiers as the International Cricket Council's One Day International (ODI) Cricketer of the Year for scoring 7 000 ODI runs, is commendable.1.5. Cabinet welcomes the launch of the A Re Yeng Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) service in Tshwane, which started operating from Monday, 17 November 2014. The A Re Yeng, like other BRT services around the country, forms part of a strategic public transport network that will improve the lives of commuters by providing them with fast, safe, affordable and comfortable urban mobility. The construction of these services forms part of government s infrastructure roll-out programme, which intends to develop a world class infrastructure in South Africa, while creating jobs.2. Key Cabinet decisions2.1. Cabinet approved implementation of a comprehensive program to ensure compliance with existing localisation procurement leverage policies and regulations. This includes a policy alignment process to review and strengthen the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act, extending the Competitive Supplier Development Program to all strategic State-Owned Companies as well as strengthening departmental regulations (particularly the mining charter) to enable local procurement.This is a powerful instrument for industrialisation which will enhance the competitiveness of national industry, enable the development of new national industrial and technological capabilities, increase exports and achieve deeper black economic empowerment.2.2. Cabinet was appraised on the Presidential Local Government Summit, and approved the Back to Basics Programme for Local Government, which is based on building a responsive, caring and accountable local government sector. The Back to Basics Programme will focus planning and operations of all municipalities on the effective delivery of basic municipal services and regular communication with residents. The aim is to move from intent to action.Improvements in the performance of municipalities will improve the living conditions of all South Africans that depend on well-functioning municipalities to lead dignified lives.Since 1994, local government has been a primary site for the delivery of service.While there has been unprecedented progress in delivering water, electricity, sanitation and refuse removal at local levels, in areas where service delivery is failing we need to put people and their concerns first. This requires that we move away from the outdated top down service delivery to a culture of Batho Pele and serving communities. Crucial to this new approach is a system of reporting on, and being accountable for performance.2.3. Cabinet approved the submission of South Africa s Biennial Update Report on Emission Reductions, inclusive of the Final 2000-2010 National Green House (GHG) Inventory, to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It provides an overview and analysis of South Africa s GHG emissions profile and key drivers of change in emissions. It also highlights the comprehensive suite of climate change measures as part of the transition to a low-carbon economy.These include defining desired emission reduction outcomes; promoting innovation and investment in renewable energy; encouraging energy efficiency; creating a national system for greenhouse gas data collection; and other instruments such as Carbon Tax. This also forms part of South Africa s international reporting obligation under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).2.4. Cabinet approved the establishment of an inter-departmental task team under the International Cooperation, Trade and Security Cluster to oversee the implementation of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement.South Africa s position is to work with other African countries to ensure that the adoption and implementation of the Trade Facilitation Agreement does not require African countries to accept obligations they do not have the capacity to meet and that expose them to legal challenges. While South Africa remains committed to the multilateral negotiations under the Doha Round, our position is to seek an outcome that preserves our space to pursue policies that support industrial development and employment that lie at the heart of the objectives set out in the National Development Plan.South Africa has affirmed the importance of fully multilateral and inclusive approaches to the conduct of WTO business as best suited to balanced, equitable outcomes that meet the interests of all Members.2.5. Cabinet was updated on the Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa   East African Community   Southern African Development Community (COMESA-EAC-SADC) Tripartite Free Trade Agreement (TFTA) and also approved South Africa s position on the TFTA. The Tripartite initiative is a key African led project aimed at promoting economies of scale, enabling competitiveness, diversification, fostering regional value-chains, intra-regional trade and investment, and cross-border infrastructure.South Africa negotiates as part of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) that negotiates as one entity. The Tripartite countries have a combined gross domestic product of US$1.2 trillion and a combined population of approximately 626 million people, representing just over half the total African population and economy. Regional integration to create larger markets for accelerated and sustainable growth in Africa is a decisive step to overcome the colonial heritage of small fragmented African markets.2.6. Cabinet was briefed on the G20 Brisbane Summit proposals for a more intensive, intrusive and effective approach to regulating the financial sector. This contributes to continued financial stability and resilience of the global and domestic financial system. Following the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, G20 Leaders committed to fundamental reform on the global financial system. Their objectives were to connect the fault lines that led to the global crisis and to build safer, more resilient sources of finance to better serve the needs of the real economy.Over the past five years, the G20 focused on dealing with the fault lines that caused the crisis, by strengthening international standards to build more resilient financial institutions and more robust markets. The Brisbane Summit concluded the first phase of financial reform, and going forward the Financial Stability Board will adjust its focus to mitigating new and constantly evolving risks and vulnerabilities. South Africa will continue to participate in the Financial Stability Board and associated regulatory forums which work to promote a system based on mutual trust and cooperation which is essential to maintain an open global financial system that can achieve the G20 s objective of strong, sustainable and balanced growth.2.7. Cabinet noted and ratified the resolutions of the President s Coordination Council (PCC) meeting held on 18 March 2014, for purposes of implementation. Key resolutions include:(a) alignment and implementation of the National Development (NDP) to reflect progress made by the local government sector in implementing the NDP. National government departments, the National Planning Commission and provinces to ensure that municipal plans are aligned to the NDP and other national plans; (b) addressing capacity needs of the three spheres of government to support municipalities to deliver on their mandates; (c) urgency in attaining transformative local government and addressing impediments associated with achieving equitable and effective municipal governance, addressing challenges relating to apartheid spatial patterns in towns and cities.2.8. Cabinet was briefed on preparations for the 2016 Municipal Elections and approved the establishment of an Inter-Ministerial Task Team and a Technical Task Team on Municipal Elections. Cabinet also approved submission of the amendment to the Local Government: Municipal Structures Act, 1998 (Act No. 117 of 1998) to Parliament, so as to provide for the President (previously the Minister) to set a date for election of all municipal councils. The 2016 municipal elections will be the fourth elections since our democracy and the advanced preparations ensure that these elections are just as successful as the previous ones.3. Bills3.1. Cabinet approved the submission of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related mattes) Amendment Bill, 2014 to Parliament. The Bill addresses two separate Constitutional Court judgments, by amending the applicable sections of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related matters) Amendment Act, 2007, to remedy the current position of constitutional invalidity. The primary objective of sections 15 and 16 of the Act, namely to protect vulnerable children against sexual exploitation by adults, remains unaffected by the proposed amendments.The proposed amendment to sections 50 and 51 of the Act aims to give effect to the principle that the best interests of children are of paramount importance in all matters that concern them.3.2. Cabinet approved the introduction of the Judicial Matters Amendment Bill, 2014 to Parliament. The Bill amends numerous Acts, administered by the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development, to address practical and technical challenges, with a view to enhance organisation efficiency and accountability.3.3. Cabinet approved the introduction of the draft Banks Amendment Bill, 2014 in Parliament. The amendment to the Banks Act, 1990 (Act No. 94 of 1990) enhances curatorship of banks in order to make the financial sector safer and protect depositors. In prompting the soundness of the banking system it is imperative that the regulation and supervision of banks are based on international standards and best practice.The Bill seeks to enhance the powers of the curator of a bank while under curatorship by:(a) providing an alternative to the recovery of a bank within the existing corporate entity, (b) facilitating the transfer of all or part of a bank s business to a successor entity pursuant to a transfer under section 54 of the Banks Act; and (c) facilitating the implementation of the above steps by the curator.4. Cabinet s Position on Current Issues 4.1. Cabinet commends the collaboration between government, the community sector and academia in promoting youth education and empowerment, which led to the launch of Thusanani Foundation by President Jacob Zuma. This youth-led non-profit organisation will bridge the educational information gap between rural high school learners and their urban counterparts, which will in turn improve academic performance. Two scholarships, the Pixley ka Isaka Seme Scholarship Fund and the Johnstone Mfanafuthi Makhatini International Scholarship Fund are to be launched.4.2. Cabinet was heartened by the arrival of the mortal remains of those South Africans killed in the building collapse in Lagos, Nigeria on 12 September 2014.Cabinet commends the tireless efforts of those involved in the repatriation process and appreciates the cooperation received from officials in Nigeria in expediting the process given its complexities.Government continues to support the affected families and hopes that this will assist them to reach closure. We will intensify our efforts to ensure the remains of 11 South Africans that are still to be identified in Nigeria, are brought home without undue delay. Cabinet expresses its gratitude to all South Africans for uniting as a nation during this trying time.Cabinet send its condolences to the family of the late Dennis Furhri who passed on whilst deployed as part of repatriation of mortal remains of South Africans who perished when a church collapsed in Nigeria on 12 September 2014. South Africa has lost a dedicated and committed public servant.4.3. Cabinet welcomes the appointment of the independent panel to investigate the alleged criminal acts by present and past South African Revenue Service officials and urges members of the public to allow the panel space to complete their investigation.These developments should not detract from the proven track record of SARS as a model public entity that ensures the country has the finances to meet its various economic and social commitments. 4.4. Cabinet welcomes the meeting between the South African Airways board, Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown and Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene to chart a way forward for the airline and expects the intervention to yield tangible results at the national carrier and put it back on a path towards profitability and good governance.4.5. Cabinet to bolster the National Treasury response that Moody s decision to downgrade South Africa s investment grade credit rating to  Baa2 / P-2  from  Baa1 / P-2  and revise the credit outlook to stable from negative, comes during a period of slow economic growth.Cabinet to reiterate that the Medium Term Strategic Framework already prioritises growth-inducing initiatives such as major projects in rail, energy and ports that will boost investment. Focus in the medium term will also be on accelerating the structural changes that are currently underway and whose impact will support economic growth.4.6. Cabinet was shocked and disappointed at the recent unruly conduct of some members of the National Assembly. Such conduct goes against the ethos of our struggle for freedom and detracts from the journey we have made in our 20 Years of Freedom.The integrity of Parliament as a democratic institution must be protected and guarded by all members. The unruly behaviour erodes accountability to all South Africans and detracts from Parliament s role to uphold the values and principles enshrined in the Constitution.5. Upcoming events5.1. President Jacob Zuma will attend the Botswana South Africa Bi-National Commission (BNC) in Gaborone, Botswana on 20 November 2014. The BNC remains an important platform to enhance bilateral relations and cooperation.5.2. President Zuma will receive Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Tshwane from 26 to 27 November 2014. This visit will build on the strong, brotherly relations between South Africa and Palestine, which was founded in the liberation struggle. The bi-lateral will focus on relations between South African and Palestine, the Middle East Peace Process and how South Africa can continue to the Palestinian struggle for freedom and self-determination.5.3. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will attend the second Turkey Summit which will be Malabo, Equatorial Guinea on 21 November, 2014. The purpose of the Summit is to assess   progress made by  the Joint Implementation Plan of Africa-Turkey Partnership 2010-2014 . This Partnership contributes to Africa s development within the objectives set by African Union s Agenda 2063.Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, as chair of South African National AIDS Council (SANAC), will mark World AIDS Day on 1 December 2014 in Virginia, Lejweleputswa, in the Free State under the theme:  Zero Stigma and Discrimination . South Africa has made great progress in working towards reaching the goals of the National Strategic Plan for HIV and AIDS, TB and STIs 2012   2016. Unfortunately, stigma and discrimination continues to affect the successful implementation of this strategy and has contributed to a lower uptake of HIV preventative services.Cabinet calls on all communities to support, care and accept those living with HIV and AIDS. All South Africans are urged to practise safe sex; get tested for HIV at least once a year so as to make informed decisions on preventative measures, treatment, care and support; and for men and boys to take up medical male circumcision services.5.4. The Department of Environmental Affairs will participate in the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 20) and the 10th session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CPM10), which will be held in Lima, Peru from 1 to 12 December 2014. The Lima Climate Change Conference is critical for the successful conclusion of the negotiation for the 2015 agreement. South Africa s approved position at the negotiations is aligned to the country s national interest and the National Development Plan.5.5. The Department of Arts and Culture and the Department of Sport and Recreation will host the second edition of the Nelson Mandela Sport and Culture Day at the Union Buildings, Tshwane on 22 November 2014 under the theme: UNITE: One Man, One Nation, One Celebration.Cabinet encourages all South Africans to participate in communal sports and culture activities since both have the power to unite all South Africans. The event is also an opportunity to appreciate the values of former President Nelson Mandela and reflect on ways in which we can continue his legacy.5.6. Cabinet noted commemoration of the 16 Days of Activism which marks the 16th anniversary of the campaign, starting from 25 November to 10 December. The theme for this year is  Count me in, Together moving a non violent South Africa. Through this theme, the 2014 campaign aims to continue generating awareness on the protection of women and children. The theme also focuses more on mobilising men as partners in this campaign to refuse this scourge.6. AppointmentsCabinet approved the following appointments:6.1.

Statement on Cabinet meeting of 10 December 2014,11 Dec 2014,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-10-december-2014,https://www.gov.za/statement-cabinet-meeting-10-december-2014,"From the outset, Cabinet would like to clarify the misperception that President Jacob Zuma has refused to answer questions in Parliament. Cabinet also noted efforts by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to interact with political parties in the National Assembly following chaotic scenes recently.The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa stipulates that the President is accountable to Parliament. The President has continuously fulfilled his role of accounting to Parliament. He has been answering written and oral questions posed to him by the members in both the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces.The President went to orally answer questions in the National Assembly on 21 August 2014. Unfortunately Honourable Members disrupted him whilst answering the third of six questions posed to him. It is the Honourable Members who, through their own disrespectful behaviour, disrupted the President as he was answering questions. Those Honourable Members who prevented the President from orally answering questions in the National Assembly have no moral grounds to twist the facts and suddenly claim that it is the President who does not want to orally reply to their questions. The National Assembly has since censured those Honourable Members who disrupted the President.Further, Cabinet is not aware of any Order Paper in the National Assembly which had scheduled the President to answer oral questions after the disruption of his oral replies. Therefore it cannot be true that the President has refused to answer questions in the National Assembly.Cabinet remains concerned over the disruptive effect of the recent power outages on the daily lives of South Africans and their impact on households and businesses across the country. Cabinet has adopted a five-point plan to address the electricity challenges facing the country. The lack of sufficient capacity to meet the country s energy needs remains a challenge and all attempts are being made to ensure that we overcome the tight energy situation.To meet the country s future energy requirements government is implementing an energy mix which comprises coal, solar, wind, hydro, gas and nuclear energy. In future biomass, wind power, solar power and hydro-power will contribute 11.4 Gigawatts of renewable energy to the grid.Since 1994, five million more households were connected to the grid. In 2004 this increased to 12 million households. This happened without additional power stations being built. This increase of households was set off the existing grid.Today Eskom will sign Memorandum of Understanding with the Strategic Fuel Fund and Transnet Ports Authority so that the country can be assured of a regular supply of diesel. The focus will be to improve the strategic maintenance and operational efficiency to ensure that the level of efficiency is increased from the current 72% to the target of 80%. Eskom will present a detailed finance plan to manage its cash flow beyond 2015. This plan will be presented to the IMC by December 2014. Simultaneously government will finance the funding model.Cogeneration (the generation of electricity and useful heat jointly, especially the use of the steam left over from electricity generation for heating) options will be pursued with the sugar paper and pulp industries to harness waste energy to the extent of 1000 megawatts. There are significant opportunities for the importation of gas. A coal independent power producer programme will be launched by the end of January 2015 with a generation capacity of 2 500 megawatts.We are therefore appealing to the public to help our country to reduce the demand of energy, which means switching off electricity when not in use. We will have some relief from  15 December 2014 when manufacturing and industrial processes close for the year. A technical team war room for the implementation of the five-point plan has been constituted with immediate effect. The five-point plan addresses the strain our electricity system faces.The plan covers:the interventions that Eskom will undertake in the period over the next 30 days;harnessing the cogeneration opportunity through the extension of existing contracts with the private sector;accelerating the programme for substitution of diesel with gas to fire up the diesel power plants;launching a coal independent power producer programme; andmanaging demand through specific interventions within residential dwellings, public and commercial buildings and municipalities through retrofitting energy efficient technologies.Cabinet is concerned about the performance of some of the State-owned companies (SoCs), in particular the South African Airways (SAA), South African Post Office (SAPO) and Eskom. These SOCs play a critical developmental role within the South African economy.The President has assigned Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to oversee the turnaround of  the SAA, SAPO and Eskom. Working with the relevant ministries, the SAA will be transferred from the Department of Public Enterprises to National Treasury. The Presidency will closely monitor the implementation of the turnaround plans of these three critical SOCs that are drivers of the economy.1. Implementation of key government programmes1.1. Cabinet welcomes the positive outcomes of the President s State Visit to the People s Republic of China from 4 to 5 December 2014, which is a true reflection of the deepening bilateral, trade and investment relations between South Africa and China.South African businesses are urged to take advantage of the new economic opportunities that our relationship with China offers. Last week s adoption of the China-South Africa 5-10 Year Framework on Cooperation entrenches implementation of the agreements entered into since the conclusion of the Beijing Declaration in 2010 and expands on the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.1.2. Cabinet lauds the Department of Basic Education, provincial education departments, principals, teachers and learners for their perseverance as we conclude another busy academic year.The Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga will announce the outcome of the 2014 National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations on 5 January 2015 and the results will be released to candidates on 6 January 2015.Cabinet encourages learners who qualify for higher education studies to explore all available opportunities. Those learners who have not yet been accepted at an institution of higher learning at the time of the release of the NSC results should make use of the Central Applications Clearing House (CACH) service in January and February 2015.The CACH service develops a register of potential candidates that meet institutions' minimum admission requirements to all Post-School Education and Training (PSET) institutions in South Africa. The service also offers career advice and assists prospective applicants with possible alternatives. The service can be accessed through the call centre on: 0800 356 635 or through an SMS with your name and identity number to 49200.1.3. Cabinet welcomes the release of the 2014 Annual National Assessments (ANA) last week which shows an upward trend in performance of all grades except Grade 9.The ANA remain a powerful tool to assess the health of our education system and where immediate interventions are required as identified for the Grade 9 learners in mathematics.1.4. Cabinet thanks all South Africans, civil society and the media for their participation in this year s 16 Days of Activism campaign under the theme:  Count me in: Together moving a non-violent South Africa forward .The call to all South Africans to  Count me in  seeks to ensure the longevity of established partnerships by translating our activism during this period into everyday actions throughout the year so that we can eliminate the scourge of violence against women and children.1.5. South Africa will mark National Reconciliation Day on 16 December 2014 under the theme:  Social Cohesion, Reconciliation and National Unity in the 20 Years of Democracy  at the Ncome Museum in the uMzinyathi District Municipality, KwaZulu-Natal.1.6. Cabinet conveys its gratitude to all South Africans and the international community that commemorated the anniversary of the passing of the country s first democratically elected President Nelson Mandela on 5 December 2014.We must stay true to Madiba s legacy by continuing his unwavering dedication to democracy, selflessness, reconciliation, service to humanity and striving for a better life for all. It is through these values and dedication to the service of humanity that we remain inspired to become a united and prosperous nation.2. Key Cabinet decisions2.1. Cabinet approved that the 2013/14 performance report of the Research and Development (R&D) Tax Incentive programme be tabled in Parliament.Government offers R&D tax incentive in terms of Section 11D of the Income Tax Act of 1962 in order to encourage private sector R&D activities. South Africa offers 150% deduction on approved operational expenditure incurred on R&D activities and is recognised to be amongst the countries that offer the more generous tax incentive for R&D.The incentive which has been in place since November 2006 saw 810 companies participating, as at February 2014. From 2005/06 to 2012/13 companies reported an estimated R44.1 billion R&D expenditure, and National Treasury estimated that just over R3,2 billion was claimed in R&D tax deduction from the South Arican Revenue Service (SARS). 2013/14 saw 44.2% small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with an annual turnover of less than R40 million participating in the R&D tax incentive.2.2. Cabinet was updated on progress made with the MeerKAT project, the collateral benefits that have accrued to the local communities and South Africa, and the international negotiations underway relating to the hosting of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project.The construction of the MeerKAT telescope   the pathfinder to the eventual SKA   is progressing well, with significant opportunities for the local South African industry. South Africa is driving a number of cutting-edge technology developments, especially in the area of high performance computing. Local communities in the Northern Cape have also benefitted through the many social investment partnerships.On the international front, the hosting agreement, the funding model for the SKA and the procurement policy are being discussed and finalised. Negotiations are also continuing on the establishment of an inter-governmental treaty organisation.Cabinet approved a joint task team between the Ministers of Science and Technology and Higher Education and Training to identify the required human resources and to ensure that academic and other research institutions are aligned to the development and needs of the MeerKAT, SKA and similar projects.Cabinet also approved collaboration between the Ministers of Science and Technology and Small Business Development should opportunities arise for empowering and capacitating small and medium enterprises in light of the potential economic impact.2.3. Cabinet approved for Statistics South Africa to conduct stakeholder consultations in preparation for the amendment of the Statistics Act, 1999 (Act 6 of 1999). Consultations between the organs of state and other relevant organs are necessary to facilitate the development of the series of data collections needed for the National Development Plan (NDP).2.4. Cabinet was briefed on the compliance of members of the Senior Management Service (SMS) with the Financial Disclosure Framework, which is monitored by Parliament.Of the 5 425 SMS members in national departments who were required to submit their financial disclosures forms for the 2012/13 financial year, the Public Service Commission  received 4 413 (81%) by the due date of 31 May 2013.Cabinet highlights that a culture of zero tolerance for non-compliance should be entrenched in the day-to-day functioning of the State.2.5. Cabinet was briefed on the 2013/2014 audit outcomes of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) compliant institutions and on the tabling status of their annual reports and financial statements.There has been an improvement in compliance by institutions on the timeous tabling of their 2013/14 annual reports and financial statements. For the year under review 417 PFMA compliant institutions were required to table their annual reports and financial statements by 30 September 2014. A total of 379 institutions (91%) met the deadline which is a 7% improvement from the 353 in the previous year.Cabinet approved that accounting officers and accounting authorities submit to their relevant executive authorities corrective steps that would be taken to address concerns raised in their audit reports.Cabinet supports the need for Executive Authorities to monitor the progress made to address concerns raised in Audit Reports and to receive regular updates thereon.2.6. Cabinet approved a range of steps to reform the Supply Chain management (SCM) system. These include: (a) SCM performance criteria to be included in the performance agreements of accounting officers as from 1 April 2015; (b) Accounting officers to conduct a capacity review of SCM staff and to take remedial action where required; (c) Accounting officers to brief executive authorities quarterly on the SCM performance in their department, municipalities or entities.Cabinet also approved for the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer to accelerate the SCM reform by modernising the function in the public service. The Office of the Chief Procurement Officer has embarked on a strategy to simplify, standardise and automate procurement.National Treasury will conduct consultations with the National School of Government with a view to develop a curriculum on training and standardisation of professional qualifications.2.7. Cabinet approved the submission of South Africa s Periodic Report (2002-2013) on the United Nations (UN) International Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman Degrading Treatment or Punishment to the UN Human Rights Council.Compilation and submission of this report demonstrates governments  commitment to the global effort to protect and promote human rights. South Africa fully complies with the convention in that it has criminalised torture, and courts may now prosecute torture in terms of statute and not common law.The report provides South Africa with an opportunity to assess its compliance or lack thereof with international obligations. The fight against torture is in line with South Africa s key priority of ensuring safer communities which is in line with the NDP.2.8. Cabinet noted the draft White Paper on the Police. The 2014 White Paper on Police emanates from a review of the 1998 White Paper on Safety and Security. The review reassessed how the practice and understanding of crime prevention has developed in South Africa post 1994.The White Paper responds to the NDP Vision 2030 by articulating the need and framework for a professional police service that is skilled, accountable and community-centered. In addition the police service is required to operate in an integrated manner within the criminal justice system in executing its constitutional mandate.2.9. Cabinet approved that the draft Youth Policy 2014-2019 be made available for public comment. The draft policy is a progression from the first Youth Policy 2009-2014. Youth development is at the core of South Africa s development agenda; the NDP has a youth lens aimed at nurturing a demographic dividend.The 2014-2019 policy ensures that the youth dividend is realised. Implementation of the policy will intentionally enhance the capabilities of young people to transform the economy and society by addressing their needs for holistic development, particularly those outside the social, political and economic mainstream.2.10. Cabinet also approved publication of the draft National Disability Rights Policy in the Government Gazette for public comment. This serves to: update the White Paper on an Integrated National Disability Strategy, integrates both the obligations in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the provisions of the Continental Plan of Action for the African Decade of Persons with Disabilities with South African legislation, policy frameworks and the NDP 2030.2.11. Cabinet approved the proposed vision for the Border Management Agency of South Africa as a basis for the business case and enabling legislation as work in progress. Cabinet also approved that a pilot site be established and a proper legal framework be put in place.A two-phased approach will be used to establish the agency:Transition Phase (January 2015-December 2016)   used to start legislative drafting and its enactment and to make government initiatives in the borderline environment more visible. There will also be a continuation with current collaborative efforts at ports of entry under formalised multiparty agreements to strengthen the Border Control Operational Coordinating Committee s management authority.Agency Phase (January 2017 and beyond)   entails implementation of legislation to operationalise the agency as a public entity in the ports of entry environment and to provide for the expansion of its mandate and functions to include the air, land (Border Guard) and maritime (Coast Guard) border environment.The experiences of the transitional phase (including the pilot) will better inform the final proposals.2.12. Cabinet approved the relocation of the lead agency role for the Border Control Operational Coordinating Committee from Sars to the Department of Home Affairs.2.13. Cabinet was briefed on the results of a pilot audit on transformation in a sample of National Sport Federations. This provided the extent to which sport bodies in South Africa have transformed over the last two decades since the targets for transformation in sport were set. The results will be used by the Department of Sport and Recreation to provide focused support to those federations that need administrative support.The purpose of the study was to establish a draft framework for evaluating the transformation in the different dimensions of the transformation charter; performance levels, demographics, access, skills and capabilities, governance, employment equity, and preferential procurement.Based on the lessons learnt from the first pilot study, the second phase of the audit began in March 2014. The scope of this audit covers all 16 priority sport codes.2.14. Cabinet declared an annual National Recreation Day on the first Friday of October each year. This provides an opportunity to all South Africans to actively be involved by participating in recreation activities that will improve their health and well-being.A healthy and active citizenry is a key factor in realising the NDP.To fully exploit the potential of recreation, the National Recreation Day needs solidarity, joint activities and cross-sectoral initiatives. To this end Cabinet also approved the establishment of a National Steering Committee.3. Bills3.1. Cabinet approved publication of the second draft of the Financial Sector Regulation Bill and its submission to Parliament and the release of the Draft Market Conduct Policy Framework for public comment. The draft framework will enable the public to be better informed when commenting on the Bill.3.1.1. The second draft of the Financial Sector Regulation Bill, 2014 follows comments received on the first draft which was approved by Cabinet in December 2013. The aim of the Bill is to make the financial sector safer by implementing the  twin peaks  regulatory system, which is a comprehensive and complete system for regulating the financial sector, prioritising the customer and protecting their funds.The  twin peaks  approach to financial regulation underpins a comprehensive regulatory system, with two aims: (a) to strengthen the financial stability and soundness of financial institutions by creating a dedicated  Prudential Authority  (within the South African Reserve Bank) and (b) to protect financial customers and ensure that they are treated fairly by financial institutions by creating a dedicated Financial Sector Conduct Authority, which also supervises how financial services conduct their business.The Bill will provide the Financial Sector Conduct Authority and the Prudential Authority  jurisdiction over all financial institutions and provide them with a range of supervisory tools to fulfil their mandates.This goes beyond two regulators as it sets up an underlying and harmonised system of licensing, supervision, enforcement, customer complaints (including ombuds), appeal mechanism (tribunal) and consumer advice and education.3.1.2. The Draft Market Conduct Policy Framework drives fair treatment of customers in the financial sector, which is a key lesson for South Africa from the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. While South Africa s financial sector has proven to be resilient, government has recognised that the sector could be delivering better outcomes for financial customers and the economy.There have been a number of well-known market conduct failings in South Africa s financial sector, and government has intervened to address these. However, the persistence of systematic market conduct challenges has highlighted the need for a more comprehensive and holistic approach to addressing the problem of poor conduct across the financial sector in its entirety.3.2. Cabinet approved submission of the Plant Breeders Rights Amendment Bill to Parliament. The Bill amends the Plant Breeders  Rights Act, 1976 (Act 15 of 1976). The Bill aims to strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights relevant to new varieties of plants. Such protection contributes to economic growth as it has a positive impact on the competitiveness of South Africa s agricultural sector.Some of the key amendment proposals include: extending protection to all plant genera and species; addressing matters of infringement of plant breeders  rights through the appropriate fines and penalties and defining the limits and the beneficiaries in the application of farmer s privilege; and empowering the Minister to establish a Plant Breeders  Rights Advisory Committee to advise the Registrar on matters related to plant variety protection.3.3. Cabinet approved the submission of the Plant Improvement Amendment Bill to Parliament.The Plant Improvement Act, 1976 (Act 53 of 1976), which has been amended a few times, the last being in 1996, regulates plant improvement in South Africa. The amendments align the scope and provisions of the Act to the Constitution and other related legislation in the agricultural sector.The Bill enhances sustainable crop production in South Africa by regulating the quality of plants and seed.The significance and role of plant improvement legislation lies in recognising the importance of quality plant propagating material to support sustainable production as well as participation in the global market by setting quality standards for plants and seeds and the types of business dealing with plants and seed.3.4. Cabinet approved submission of the Performing Animals Protection Amendment Bill to Parliament.The Bill amends section 2 and 3 of the Performing Animals Protection Act 1935 (Act  24 of 1935) which were declared unconstitutional insofar as they relate to magistrates deciding on and issuing licences to persons intending to train and exhibit animals and to persons who use dogs for safeguarding.The Bill proposes to remedy the defect identified by the Constitutional Court by transferring the functions of issuing licences for performing animals from the Judiciary to the Executive.This is within the context of the Animal Protection Act, 1962 (Act 71 of 1962) which consolidates the laws relating to the prevention of cruelty to animals.4. Cabinet s position on current issues 4.1. Cabinet calls on all South Africans to join the fight against Ebola by participating in the African Union (AU) SMS resource mobilisation campaign. The AU Commission has so far raised more than 20 million dollars in donations through its hashtag ""#AfricaAgainstEbola"" campaign, but more is still needed. By sending a  Stop Ebola  SMS to 40797 South Africans will not only be donating R10 but will also fuel the hope and determination that Ebola can and will be stopped.4.2. Cabinet wishes all a restful, peaceful year-end holiday and urges South Africans to put Ubuntu/Botho in practice by assisting those in our communities that are unable to support themselves and to show compassion as a nation that cares for, and respects each other. All parents to take care of their children during this period. Victims of abuse must speak out, report abuse and contact the 24 hour command centre 0800 428 428.Cabinet calls on all South Africans to take every precaution during the upcoming festive season, stay away from the abuse of alcohol and drugs, and to enjoy the holiday period in a safe and responsible manner. All South Africans have a part to play in curbing incidents of crime, accidents and abuse, which tend to increase during this period.Cabinet reiterates that traffic officials will have a zero tolerance approach to lawlessness on our roads during this festive season. We urge all road users to adhere to the speed limit; ensure vehicles are roadworthy; not to drive intoxicated and to wear safety belts. Pedestrians are urged to ensure that when using the roads they do not endanger their well-being or that of motorists.Government will play its part by leading a range of campaigns such as Healthy Lifestyles and Arrive Alive in a bid to partner with communities to promote responsible and safe behaviour.4.3. Cabinet is saddened by the tragic killing of South African teacher Pierre Korkie who was in Yemen, and that of Werner Groenewald, and his two children, Rode and Jean-Pierre who died in an attack in Afghanistan. Cabinet conveys its condolences to their families and friends.4.5. The work to identify the remaining 11 South Africans who died tragically in the Nigerian building collapse continues and government is intensifying efforts to ensure their remains are brought home without undue delay.4.6. Cabinet conveys its condolences to the Gigaba family on the loss of their father, Reverend Jabulani Gigaba. He was the father to the Minister of Home Affairs, Mr Malusi Gigaba. Cabinet also conveys its condolences to the family and friends of Sisi Mabe, who was the Speaker of the Free State Legislature.4.7. Cabinet congratulates the national soccer team Bafana Bafana and coach Ephraim  Shakes  Mashaba on qualifying for the Africa Cup of Nations 2015 in Equatorial Guinea, which begins on 17 January 2015, and calls on all South Africans to support the national team as they fly our flag high.4.8. Cabinet noted the launch of the Human Settlements Youth Brigade on 1-2 December 2014 by the Departments of Human Settlements, Small Business Development, and the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) at the National Human Settlements Youth Summit.The summit deliberated on the empowerment programmes of the departments targeting young people and how they can participate in the delivery of houses. At the end of the summit all stakeholders signed the National Human Settlements Youth Accord which serves as a statement of intent towards creating a holistic and integrated approach to human settlements delivery through youth mobilisation, development and participation in a form of National Human Settlements Youth Brigades. The intention is to mobilise young people behind the target of 1.5 million housing opportunities and aims to recruit and train about 10 000 Youth Brigades in the next five years.5.

Implementation of Key Government Programmes1.1. Cabinet welcomes President Jacob Zuma s State of the Nation Address, which afforded South Africans an opportunity to hear government Programme of Action. Government calls on all stakeholders across the country to Work Together on the nine-point plan in order to ignite growth and create jobs.

These include the Ministerial Cluster Media briefings held from 15 to 24 February 2015.In addition, the 2015/16 Budget Speech scheduled for the 25 February 2015 will highlight the allocation of resources to the various government programmes as emphasised by the President.Cabinet condemns the unruly and un-parliamentary conduct of some Members of Parliament during the opening of Parliament.It is disappointing that these elected public representatives chose to dishonor the sacrifices and struggle made to realise our hard-earned democracy.1.2 Cabinet was briefed on the progress made with the oceans economy Operation Phakisa. The  Lab  or planning phase took place in Durban during July and August 2014 and resulted in the production of detailed  three feet plans  to grow the ocean economy.

This forms part of the South African Integrated Programme of Action for Early Childhood Development   Moving ahead 2013-2016, approved by Cabinet on 18 September 2013. The Policy provides a framework for government s accountability to provide a comprehensive package of quality Early Childhood Development services that would be universally available in sufficient quantities and proximity so that all children enjoy an equal opportunity to access them.The policy also   introduces a number of new services to fill gaps identified in the range of services currently available especially within the first  1 000 days of a child s life.Cabinet also approved the establishment of an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC), which will ensure a coherent and coordinated approach. It will be chaired by the Minister of Social Development.1.5 Cabinet approved the release of the Draft First Periodic Country report on the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, for public comment for a period of 20 days.

Maps help to understand problems and possibilities, such as the provision of housing, sustaining natural resources, managing risk and facilitating timely and comprehensive transportation infrastructure. Understanding geospatial information informs planning and decision making for the development of South Africa.2. Key Cabinet decisions2.1 Cabinet approved the Directive on the implementation of competency based assessments for member of the Senior Management (SMS), issued in terms of Chapter 4 part II (d) and Chapter 4, part VI of the Public Service Regulations, 2001.The amended Directive promotes the independent identification of SMS Member s  developmental gaps, introduces the use of technical exercises and provides guidance on how departments can utilize the competency assessment results in conjunction with all other processes of recruitment and selection.2.2 Cabinet approved the hosting of the National Imbizo Focus Week from 7 to 12 April 2015 under the theme  Together we move South Africa forward .The Week will be characterized by door-to-door household profiling; walkabout or project visits; stakeholder dialogues; community engagements; as well as commercial and community media engagements.

The establishment of a municipality in Malamulele should be within the confines of the law as prescribe by the Demarcation Board.4.2 Cabinet condemns attacks on foreign nationals as criminal activity and reiterates that law enforcement agencies will not hesitate to act decisively against anyone found to incite such violence. No amount of economic hardship and discontent can justify criminal activity associated with these attacks.

As a signatory to this Protocol, and as a country that cherishes human rights, we will protect the basic rights of every human being within our borders, including foreign nationals.4.3 Cabinet approved the tabling in Parliament for ratification, the Treaty Establishing the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement and Agreement on the New Development Bank.

Cabinet acknowledged and welcomed the participation of South Africa in marking the World Wildlife Day on 3 March 2015. Under the stewardship of Minister Molewa South Africa continues to put in place programmes that protect the country s environment and war against poaching.Key amongst these is the placement of the Green Scorpions at OR Tambo International Airport. This is to ensure compliance with the Threatened or Protected Species Regulations, CITES Regulations, Bio-prospecting, Access and Benefit-Sharing Regulations and the Alien and Invasive Species Regulations.  South Africa has also played a key role in engaging with Interpol, particularly on the Advisory Board of the Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Committee, and in the three Interpol crime-working groups namely Wildlife Crime Working Group, Fisheries Crime Working Group and the Pollution Crime Working Group.1.4. Cabinet noted that Durban has bid to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games, which was formally lodged in London on 2 March 2015. Hosting of these games can potentially create approximately 11 650 jobs and boost the country s economy by an estimated R20 billion. Another legacy of the Games will be an integrated public transport system for Durban for which the plans have already been approved.2. Key Cabinet decisions2.1. Cabinet approved the Broadcasting Digital Migration Amendment Policy with the inclusion of the control system in the Set Top Box (STB), which will be clearly defined when the policy is published.Government will provide free STBs to more than 5 million poor television household owners. The priority will be given to those households in the border region areas of the country. The Minister of Communications will announce the digital signal switch on and analogue signal switch off date shortly.2.2 Cabinet approved the five year Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Strategic Framework and Agricultural Policy Action Plan. The Framework sets out the key challenges faced by the three sectors and propose interventions in the four areas namely equity and transformation; equitable growth and competitiveness, environmental sustainability and governance. The strategy and the action plan will be updated on an annual basis. Land distribution is one of government programmes that has promoted equity, but so far without accomplishing a great deal by way of transformation. Whereas the reconstruction and development programme declared that the main purpose of land distribution was to alter the structure of South African agriculture, it also seeks to support the sectors so as to grow the economy and create jobs.2.3. Cabinet approved for the International Hospital Federation 40th World Hospital Congress to be held in Durban towards the end of 2016. The International Hospital Federation is a global independent, non-profit, non-governmental organisation for hospitals and healthcare organisations. The annual congress affords the health practitioners an opportunity to, share best practice methodologies / approaches to improve healthcare outcomes.2.4. Cabinet calls on parents to actively get involved in the 2015 School Governing Body (SGB) elections that will take place in all public schools from 6 to 28 March 2015. The SGBs contribute in the development of a strong sense of community ownership to our schools.The general performance of schools, including academic achievement, tends to improve when parents are actively involved and take an interest in the affairs of the school. Over 250 000 governors are elected every three years to serve in our public schools united by a common purpose, to make education a real societal issue.3. Bills3.1. Cabinet approved the submission of two Bills, both amending the Children s Act, 2005 (Act No. 38 of 2005) as amended by Act 41 of 2007, to Parliament. The amendments respond to court judgments, which declared certain sections of the Act unconstitutional.Children s Amendment Bill, 2015 (section 75 Bill)    The amendments addresses the definition of  sexual offence  and aligns it to the Criminal Law (sexual offences and related matters) Amendment Act No 32 of 2007. The amendments also deal with allowing the child offenders to make representations before their names are included in the National Protection Register.The proposed amendments also clarify the requirement for placing a child in foster care and provides for additional categories of children who may be adopted.Children s Second Amendment Bill, 2015 (section 76 Bill)  - aims to ensure that all children enjoy services and benefits aimed at facilitating access to social care and safety and to create an effective social welfare system. It also seeks to provide a safe and protective environment for the placement of children who are found to be in need of care and protection.4. Cabinet s position on current issues4.1. Cabinet condemns in strongest terms the leaking of documents that may put the security of the country in jeopardy. While it is an international practice for countries to share intelligence on, among others, cross-cutting issues pertaining to economic opportunities and security matters, the purported leak of documents detailing operations of the State Security Agency is illegal.Cabinet welcomes the State Security Agency s full investigation into the matter and reassures South Africans that the State Security Agency will continue to focus on its mandate to protect and secure the integrity of the country, its citizens and infrastructure.                                                                           Cabinet reiterates the message by the Minister of State Security, Minister David Mahlobo, that such conduct undermines operational effectiveness of the work to secure the country and its borders.4.2. Cabinet welcomes the announcement by Eskom that Unit 6 of Medupi Power Station produced its first power this week, making it the first of its six units to be synchronised. Synchronisation is the process whereby the generator is electrically connected to the national power grid. Whilst we continue to work towards increasing the power supply in the national grid, Cabinet calls on the public to continue adhering to the energy saving measures. Communities are encouraged to use electricity sparingly, while we continue to introduce other alternative sources of energy.4.3 Cabinet commends the bravery, commitment, dedication and hard work of the men and women who are working tirelessly to save lives and prevent damage to property, livestock and our prestigious natural environment that  were engulfed  by the veld fires  in  Cape Town.       Cabinet expresses its gratitude to the communities that in the spirit of Ubuntu, partnered with government in setting up mass care centres to accommodate those who have been displaced. The spirit of volunteerism displayed by people who are assisting the victims of fires is enormous and encouraging.4.4 Cabinet remains concerned about the attacks of foreign nationals and warns that the law enforcement agencies will continue to have a strong presence in affected areas, and that perpetrators will face the full might of the law.  Violence against foreign nationals is being addressed decisively through various existing government structures.4.5. Cabinet congratulates the South African National Under-17 football team, the Amajimbos, for making the country proud by qualifying for the final of the 2015 African Under-17 Championship in Niamey, Niger. Their gallant performance at the African Youth Championship qualifies them for the FIFA U17 World Cup in Chile later this year.4.6. Cabinet mourned the passing of one of South Africa s musical legends Zayn Adams, a renowned lead vocalist for the seminal 70s outfit Pacific Express, whose career spanned more than 50 years. He was synonymous with Cape Town s musical history.4.7. Cabinet is pleased that, true to the characteristics of a caring government, the final phase to repatriate all the mortal remains of South Africans who were killed during the collapse of the guest house owned by the Synagogue  Church of All Nation (SCOAN) in Lagos has been concluded. Our thoughts are with the families who lost their loved ones and those who were injured in the tragedy.5. Upcoming events5.1. President Jacob Zuma will address the opening of the National House of Traditional Leaders in Parliament, Cape Town on 5 March 2015 (today).  The relationship between government and traditional leaders is critical to ensure we build vibrant, equitable and sustainable rural communities.5.2. Cabinet welcomes the return of the mortal remains of renowned struggle icons JB Marks and Moses Kotane to South Africa from Russia where they were buried 42 years ago.  These selfless leaders, who are regarded as the fathers of the liberation struggle and had inspired stalwarts such as Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo and Walter Sisulu, will receive special official funerals. President Jacob Zuma has instructed that the National Flag fly at half-mast from 9 March until the evening of 22 March 2015. Moses Kotane will be reburied in Pella, North West on 14 March 2015 and JB Marks in Ventersdorp, North West on 22 March 2015. Their return is part of government s commitment to return the remains of all of our fallen heroes who died on foreign soil. Last year renowned anti-apartheid journalist Nat Nakasa was successfully repatriated from New York to be reburied at the Heroes Acre in Chesterville, Durban.5.3. Cabinet welcomes the massive comprehensive TB screening and testing campaign  to be launched by the Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa on 24 March 2015 which is  World TB Day,  at  Dr Kenneth Kaunda District of the North West province   under the theme  Ending South Africa s TB epidemic: Accelerating our response in Key Populations . This life-long campaign will mobilise all South Africans, in particular those living in mining communities, inmates at correctional facilities and early childhood development centres, to be screened and tested for TB.In the past five years great strides have been made to strengthen government s strategies for TB control with increased screening and testing especially through the HIV Counselling and Testing campaign. Screening and testing has been further boosted by the introduction of the rapid diagnostic tests for TB and drug resistant TB.5.4. Cabinet commends the dedication and commitment of our teachers, without whom we would not have been able to achieve many of our national goals. The nominations for the National Teaching Awards recognise the outstanding contribution teachers make towards the development of our country. The awards takes place on 7 March 2015 at Gallagher Estate, Midrand.The Department of Basic Education hosts this annual event to pay tribute to dedicated, committed, hard-working and professional teachers.5.5. Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane will launch National Water Week at drought-stricken KwaDukuza in KwaZulu-Natal on 16 March 2015 under the theme:  Water Has No Substitute . This national week will conclude with World Water Day on 22 March 2015.This campaign will educate South Africans on the value of water and the need for sustainable management of this scarce resource.  Cabinet reminds all South Africans that we live in a water-scarce country and urges all to conserve it by fixing leaks and making waterwise lifestyle changes.5.6. Sunday, 8 March, marks the International Women s Day (IWD) which is a day used annually across the world to reflect on progress made, call for change and celebrate acts of courage and determination by ordinary women who played an extraordinary role in the history of their communities and countries.The Department of Women will lead the national celebration of IWD at Langa High School in Cape Town  under the theme ""Women s Rights are Human Rights: Together Moving a Non-Violent South Africa Forward"".This theme is aligned to the United Nations  theme of: ""Equality for Women is progress for all!"" and the African Union s declaration of the year 2015 as  The Year of Women Empowerment and Development towards Africa s Agenda 2063 .  The day will be used to launch the national and provincial dialogue s programme which will commence from this month until June, leading to a report on the status of women to be launched by the President on August 9.5.7. Cabinet calls on the South African media to submit their entries for the 2015 SADC Media Awards competition. The closing date is 31 March 2015 and more information is available on Department of Communications website www.doc.gov.za.The Awards link formal structures of SADC governments, civil society, academia, labour and the media.

President Jacob Zuma will lead the 50th anniversary celebrations of South Africa s nuclear research reactor SAFARI-1 operated by  the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) at Pelindaba near Pretoria. Since its commissioning on 18 March 1965, the reactor, which is a major producer of medical and industrial isotopes for both domestic and international consumption, received many accolades and international accreditation. This reactor has also played a critical role in nuclear research, development and education and has placed South Africa in the forefront of scientific advances.2.2. Cabinet calls on South Africans to nominate suitable individuals to serve on the National Planning Commission before the closing date of 10 April 2015.

The amendments include the definition of crimes of aggression and additional acts constituting the war crimes in the Rome Statute adopted by the Assembly of State Parties (in Kampala, Uganda on 11 June 2010).Ratification of these amendments to the Rome Statute by South Africa demonstrates government s commitment to fight serious crimes against humanity and crime of aggression when committed in or outside our country. 4. Cabinet s position on current issues4.1. Cabinet notes the responses to the latest round of proposed demarcations and acknowledges that robust debate is an integral part of our democracy. Since there are some municipalities that are struggling to deliver services and remain unsustainable due to insufficient revenue and inadequate governance, municipal boundaries are constantly reviewed.The proposed changes are first scrutinised by the Municipal Demarcation Board (MDB), which is charged with determining municipal boundaries in accordance with the Local Government: Municipal Demarcation Act, 1998 (Act 27 of 1998) and the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996. As an independent body, the MDB processes are transparent and consultative.  Cabinet, encourages communities to actively participate in these processes.

The work of the MDB is an integral part of government s Back to Basics approach to ensure better delivery of services to communities.4.2.

Over the duration of the investment programme a number of new jobs will be created and local businesses stand to benefit from localisation, skills development and technology transfer.The new trains will address the country s rail system backlog and will help improve the productivity and efficiency of our rail network. The launch also signals the transformation of Transnet Engineering into a fully-fledged original equipment manufacturer as 85 of the trains were produced at its facility at Koedoespoort, near Pretoria.                                                                                                                                                    5.4.

Statement on Cabinet meeting of 15 April 2015,17 Apr 2015,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-15-april-2015-17-apr-2015-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-15-april-2015-17-apr-2015-0000,"1. Recent spate of attack on foreign nationals1.1. Cabinet condemns in the strongest terms the recent acts of violence against foreign nationals. At this point, Cabinet would like to extend its heartfelt condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and a speedy recovery to those who are injured. No amount of frustration or anger can justify these attacks and looting of shops. Whilst noting the issues raised by communities, violence towards another fellow human being can never solve these issues. Rather, it reflects badly on us as a people, going against the very ideals and foundations of our democracy. South Africa fought against colonialism and Apartheid alongside fellow Africans so that all humanity in our continent should be respected and treated with dignity.1.2. The impact of these attacks has far reaching implications on our economic, social and relations with the continent and the world. South African companies who are running successful businesses in the continent who help to contribute to our revenue and sustaining our economy may suffer the same fate. Recently, South African artists who were to showcase their craft outside our borders of our country, such as BigNuz in Zimbabwe, Kelly Khumalo and Casper in London, have had their concerts cancelled as a result of these attacks. Many of our communities who relied on shops owned by foreign nationals for their bread and butter are now stranded.Today, South Africa enjoys a free country, which was attained through the contribution of a number of the African Countries. Our own late icon, President Oliver Tambo was accommodated for close to 30 years in Zambia and many other South Africans that lived in exile. Fellow African countries, did not only host our people, they also contributed resources and some paid the ultimate price and lost their own citizens in the course of South Africa attaining democracy. South Africa will never be derailed from pursuing the Pan African vision as encapsulated in AU Agenda 2063, which was since pursued by our forefathers Kwame Nkruma, Azikiwe, Mualimu Julius Nyerere and Nelson Mandela. President Jacob Zuma has tasked the Justice Crime Prevention and Security Cluster Ministers together with Ministers of Small Business Development, Trade and Industry and Social Development to engage all the relevant parties to seek a solution. The ministers have also been tasked to deal with the underlying socio-economic conditions which seems to be at the heart of these attacks, so that this matter can be dealt with decisively and comprehensively. The President has further announced the measures undertaken by the South African National Defence Force to bring control to our borders. Cabinet calls on all communities, organisations and individuals to join hands against these attacks. South Africa is not a violent country and therefore a few individuals cannot be allowed to hold the whole country at ransom. Violence has never been a solution for problems in any society and will never be in South Africa. Not in our name!2. Statues2.1. Cabinet noted the decision by the management of the university to remove the Rhodes statue from the campus of the University of Cape Town. South Africa over the last two decades has made huge strides in ensuring that our historical symbols reflect the demographics of our country and our democratic order.  Cabinet however, acknowledged that the journey of removing the historically offensive symbols and names within our country has not moved fast enough.  Cabinet noted and encourages the current broad debate that have commenced on transformation within our society, noting that transformation has not been fast enough we understand the frustrations of the students. We therefore encourage them to follow the processes as defined in our laws.     2.2. Cabinet calls on South Africans to get involved in the ongoing processes led by the Department of Arts and Culture on heritage and nation building. South Africans are reminded that the National Heritage Resources Act of 1999 outlines the consultative processes that should be followed in the case of a removal and or relocation of a statue.3. Zimbabwe State Visit3.1. Cabinet welcomes the successful Zimbabwean State visit led by President Robert Gabriel Mugabe. South Africa and Zimbabwe, have and long history of regional affiliation and cultural ties. The people of Zimbabwe have played a significant historical role in supporting the liberation struggle in South Africa. The visit elevated the bilateral relations with the establishment of the Bi-National Commission as well as the signing of three agreements and two Memoranda of Understanding.The Agreement on the Establishment of the Bi-National Commission  elevates our structured bilateral engagement to the highest level with the two Heads of State meeting to review the progress on the agreed  bilateral cooperation agreementsThe Agreement on Cooperation on Water Resources Management and the establishment and functioning of the Joint Water Commission will enhance cooperation in water resources planning, development and management in the spirit of mutual understanding and benefit. The two countries will jointly undertake a study to understand the water resources potential of the river basins in Zimbabwe to supply water to the Republic South Africa; and jointly establish water projects, which will have spin-offs in terms of job creation, economic transformation and skills development and transfer. The Agreement Regarding Mutual Assistance between Customs Administrations - Lays the basis for establishing a one-stop border post. This is a standard international model advocated by the World Customs Organisation. The purpose is to enable the two administrations to exchange information, support each other with technical assistance, and undertake surveillance, visits and investigations together and to co-operate towards enhancing the efficiency of operations. The Memorandum of Understanding on Diplomatic Consultations will establish a mechanism for regular diplomatic talks on issues in Africa and other issues of mutual interest. The key objective of this MoU is to establish a mechanism for regular diplomatic consultations on issues of strengthening bilateral relations, security and cooperation in Africa.The Memorandum of Understanding on Trade Cooperation aims to provide a platform for the two countries to consult and share experiences towards boosting economic development. The parties agreed to cooperate through trade promotion, resolution of impediments to trade and building of technical capacity in various areas identified as well as general skills developments.4. Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University4.1. Cabinet welcomes the launch of the Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University (SMU) by President Jacob Zuma in Ga-Rankuwa, Gauteng on 14 April 2015. This university, which incorporates the former MEDUNSA campus of the University of Limpopo, started its first academic year in 2015 with 5 000 students.The establishment of Sefako Makgatho University provides an excellent opportunity for the development and training of a new generation of health professionals who will make a positive impact on the lives and livelihoods of the many South Africans still marginalised by poverty and lack of access to health services. The Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University is the first stand-alone health sciences university to be established in the country. Government will continue to invest in education and skills development as a key driver to economic growth and development.5. Imbizo Focus week5.1. Cabinet expressed its gratitude to all South Africans who came out in numbers to participate in direct engagement with public representatives during the National Imbizo Focus Week themed  Together we move South Africa Forward . This is a demonstration of a maturing democracy where citizens actively participate in initiatives aimed at making government accountable as envisioned in the National Development Plan.

Cabinet has noted the progress made, but raised concerns on some of the departments that still face challenges.A comparative analysis of the National Departments  between 2013 January to October and 2014 January to October 2014 showed an improvement of 39% on  the average number of invoices paid within 30 days and a 32% improvement on the average number of invoices that were paid after the 30 days.National departments reported 155 572 invoices worth R3,8 billion which were paid after 30 days at the same time, 62 887 invoices worth R2,1 billion invoices older than 30 days had not been paid.

Cabinet approved the submission of South Africa s 1994 to 2014 Report on the Progress in the Implementation of the African Union Heads of States  Solemn Declaration on Gender Equality in Africa to the AU Secretariat. The report is in preparation for the AU Heads of States Summit to be held in June 2015.The report, which covers the period 1994 to 2014, assesses and evaluates the effectiveness of our laws, policies and programmes that were developed to increase representation, provision of basic services, job creation, poverty reduction, eradication of violence, and the protection of human rights of women and girls.3.3. Cabinet approved the National Youth Policy 2020 (NYP2020). The policy replaces the National Youth Policy 2009-2014 which has since expired. The policy was developed after an extensive consultation process with the youth of South Africa from all the nine provinces. It will form the basis for the development of an integrated Youth Development Strategy.3.4  Cabinet was briefed on the progress made in setting up the Property Management Trading Entity (PMTE). The entity ensures efficiencies and cost-effectiveness in the management of the State property portfolio. Cabinet is satisfied with the development and the refinement of the PMTE business model, which will improve the quality of public buildings.Cabinet further approved the secondment for Mr P Serote to serve as head of the PMTE, Mr M Govender as head of Facilities and Real Estate Management and Ms BS Mathews as head of Real Estate Registry Services.4.

Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, as the Chair of the South African National AIDS Council, will address the opening of the 7th South African AIDS Conference at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre in Durban from 9 to 12 June 2015 under the theme:  Reflection, Refocus and Renewal .This conference, which is held every two years, has become a barometer for government and South Africans to track advances made in controlling HIV infections. It also provides an opportunity for people working with HIV and AIDS, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and Tuberculosis (TB) to share experiences and insights.South Africa has the largest antiretroviral (ARV) programme in the world, with three million people on ARVs as of December 2014. This has significantly contributed to reducing new HIV infections and mortality from AIDS, and ensured child survival and prolonged life. Diligent planning is a major part of the success of this flagship programme, which ensures adequate availability of ARVs at every public health facility.South Africa, through the Department of Science and Technology (DST), has been investing in HIV research for many years. The DST's investment in HIV research began in 1999 when together with the Department of Health, we established the South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative.By 2009, the DST s support for HIV research was expanded to include other interventions such as diagnostics, ARVs, microbicides, in addition to vaccines. We created the South African HIV Research and Innovation Platform (SHARP) to fund pioneering HIV and AIDS research and facilitate the development of innovative solutions to the epidemic.We are currently supporting a number of HIV-related projects at various stages of development through a programme called the Strategic Health Innovation Partnership, which incorporates SHARP under the auspices of the South African Medical Research Council. The role of this programme is to facilitate the interaction of South African HIV and AIDS researchers, and to create a National Network of Collaborating Research Centres in HIV and AIDS.Currently, a number of multi-institutional, multidisciplinary, product development projects covering diagnostics, vaccines and microbicides are being pursued to advance the objectives of SHARP. South Africa attaches particular importance to the fight against AIDS, with prevention at the heart of the country s National Strategic Plan for HIV, STIs and TB (2012-2016).4.4 Environment Month ProgrammeIn June South Africa will celebrate key environment days. Led by the Department of Environmental Affairs, on 5th June, we will celebrate the World Environment Day in Kimberley, Northern Cape. The World Oceans Day on the 8th June will be hosted in Bloemfontein, Free State with various partners in the implementation of the Operation Phakisa Oceans Economy sharing information with local communities about opportunities in the ocean economy and related areas. On the 17th June South Africa will celebrate the World Day to Combat Desertification in Nqutu village, KwaZulu-Natal. All these key environment days are aimed at heightening public awareness about the environment while also exposing young people in all the host provinces to opportunities in the sector.p>4.5 Launch of the Tripartite FTA in Sharm-el-ShaikThe COMESA-EAC-SADC Tripartite Free Trade Area (TFTA) will be launched on 10 June 2015 in Sharm-el-Shaik, Egypt. The TFTA will create a market of 26 countries, with a combined population of over 625 million and a GDP of over $1 trillion.The launch signifies the conclusion of the negotiations on the Free Trade Agreement which sets rules and a framework within which tariff preferences and other commitments will be implemented. Negotiations on tariffs and rules of origin will continue as part of the built-in agenda.The launch of the TFTA is a significant milestone for the African Continent and is rooted in the African Union (AU) Lagos Plan of Action and the Abuja Treaty which aim to establish the African Economic Community. We believe that this sends a powerful message that Africa is committed to its economic integration agenda and in creating a conducive environment for trade and investment.The negotiations towards the Tripartite Free Trade Area (TFTA) were launched in June 2011 in a Summit hosted by President Jacob Zuma in Sandton, South Africa.  4.6 Launch of the negotiations for Continental FTA at the AU Summit in JuneThe launch of the Continental Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) negotiations by the AU Summit takes place on 15 June 2015 in Johannesburg, South Africa.The CFTA will, create a market of over 1.3 billion people with a combined GDP of over $2 trillion. It will build on the Tripartite Free Trade Area and progress achieved in the regional economic communities. It will also give traders and investors access to a growing market and provides a basis for enhanced intra-Africa trade.5.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 10 June 2015,11 Jun 2015,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-10-june-2015-11-jun-2015-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-10-june-2015-11-jun-2015-0000,"The Cabinet statement is available in all official languages.1.  Implementation of key government programmes1.1.    Cabinet was appraised on the outcomes reports for the fourth quarter (January-March 2015).  It was satisfied on the progress that has been made in the implementation. Members of the Executive will undertake media and stakeholder-engagement activities to unpack the progress made in the implementation of the fourth quarter outcomes. Details will be communicated as soon as this schedule is finalised.1.2.    Cabinet welcomed the selection of 13 renewable energy producers during the fourth window of government s Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme. These renewable energy producers (solar and wind power energy) will supply an additional 1 084 megawatts in support of the national grid and thus help the country to move closer towards a long-term sustainable energy supply.1.3.     Cabinet welcomes the 2013-2014 Local Government Audit Outcomes and applauds the performance of municipalities that showed a consistent improvement in almost all aspects of municipal-audit outcomes. An overwhelming 96% of auditees (municipalities and municipal entities) submitted their financial statements on time, which is a major improvement from 93% in 2012/13 and 78% in 2007/08.The report recognises that a concerted effort was made to address irregular expenditure. Notable is the significant increase in the number of municipalities and municipal entities with unqualified audits from 30 in 2012/13 to 58 in 2013/14, with only seven in 2007/08 pointing to a steady trend towards good governance and sound financial management.Auditees with financially unqualified opinions now account for 76% of the total local government expenditure budget of R315 billion. This means that almost eight out of every 10 rand spent by local government is spent by entities with financially unqualified statements.Of the 335 municipalities and entities audited, 102 improved, 194 remained constant, 27 regressed while two were new and 10 were still outstanding. This reinforces more efficient and accountable basic service delivery in line with the  Back to Basics  approach. Cabinet welcomes that as part of the Back to Basics Strategy, special attention will be given to the 50 municipalities that received disclaimed audit opinions, particularly the 25 that received disclaimed opinions for the past five years.Cabinet also expresses its concern over those municipalities that continue to employ unqualified people and thereby undermine good governance practices. The Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, working with the municipalities, will expedite the process of resolving these issues.2.       Key Cabinet decisions2.1.    Cabinet approved the Strategic Turnaround Plan of the South African Post Office (SAPO). This plan has assisted in diagnosing the root causes of problems and also identified key strategic interventions to turn the entity around. A new business model is being developed to reduce over reliance on mail business and move towards a balanced revenue mix.  Cabinet is confident the strategy will move the SAPO forward. The Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services, together with the management of the SAPO, will hold a special media briefing to unpack the plan.2.2.    Cabinet approved that the feedback received on South Africa s initial report on the implementation of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (2000-2013), be tabled in Parliament. This report was received from the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. Cabinet endorsed the governance mechanisms to ensure an integrated, coherent and participatory approach to the implementation of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child in compliance to the constitutional rights of children.Submission of South Africa s report is in line with international treaty laws and obligations. This report also serves as a barometer on how the nation is progressing on upholding children s rights and well-being.3.          Cabinet s position on current issues 3.1.    Cabinet commends the successful hosting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Africa in Cape Town last week, which reaffirms that the country is a world-class international destination for high profile events. WEF Africa provided a platform for government to showcase South Africa as an investment and business destination, which is critical to meeting the objective of the National Development Plan (NDP).Cabinet also welcomes the significant role played by the media sector in ensuring that information from this critical event was carried across various platforms to allow issues to resonate with South Africans.South Africa s credit rating at BBB by Fitch Ratings reaffirms that the country remains open to foreign investment and further demonstrates government s commitment to prudent fiscal management. Meanwhile, the issues raised by Fitch are receiving government s attention at the highest level.3.2.    Cabinet welcomes the launch of the Media Landscape 2014   Celebrating 20 Years of South Africa s Media, which captures various aspects of the inspiring past 21 years in which media have played a critical role. Each chapter considers the media landscape from 1994 and reflects on how far we have come, while considering future challenges. Most of the stakeholders agree that much has been achieved in this discipline.Cabinet urges those in the media, academia, civil society and government to read Media Landscape 2014, which provokes informed debate and discussion on the 20 years of the media in a democratic South Africa. The publication offers an objective and honest account of the country s media sector. In the drafting process it fostered strong collaboration between government and the media industry, through leaders and civil society organisations.3.3.    Cabinet affirms its confidence in the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to effectively execute its duties as mandated by our Constitution despite the recent change in its leadership.The NPA remains steadfast in its work, and has the relevant structures and systems in place to continue to promote a crime-free society. In 2014 the organisation improved its conviction rate at all court levels with 93.6 per cent (273 641 cases) at district courts, 76 per cent (27 246 cases) at regional courts and 88 per cent (911 cases) at all high courts.3.4.    Cabinet welcomes the release of the first South African Stigma Survey focusing on attitudes around HIV and AIDS and TB at the 7th South African AIDS Conference, which is currently underway in Durban. The Stigma Survey, which is the largest in the world, provides practical and innovative actions and programmes to counter stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV and TB.3.5.    Cabinet welcomed the success of Child Protection Week (CPW) and reiterates that our children are a bedrock of our country s future and urges communities to protect them against neglect and abuse. Furthermore, Cabinet conveys its gratitude to all government agencies, civil society and social partners who are working tirelessly even beyond CPW to sensitise communities on protecting our children. 3.6.    Cabinet welcomes the strong turnaround at Telkom in which government is a major shareholder, owning a 40% stake. The company s turnaround has led to strong growth in revenue and a dividend for the first time since 2011 of 245 cents.3.7.    Cabinet was appraised with the implementation of the recent immigration legislation amendments and the immigration regulations of 2014, including the requirements for travelling with children through South Africa s ports of entry, which came into operation on 1 June 2015.Cabinet has however noted the views expressed by various sectors. In order to hear these views, Cabinet has resolved to set up a team of Ministers from both the economic and security clusters. The team is expected to discuss and engage with the concerns with the aim of finding ways to address the unintended consequences brought about by the implementation of this regulations. This team will be convened by Minister Malusi Gigaba. In addition, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Migration will also continue with its work to relook at all the aspects relating to migrants that are in the country. This work will assist to provide synergy between migration and our laws.4.       Upcoming events4.1.    President Jacob Zuma will attend Youth Day celebrations on 16 June 2015 at the Tshwane Events Centre, Gauteng under the theme:  Youth moving South Africa forward . The President will also conduct a Siyahlola visit to the Tshwane University of Technology South Campus at Soshanguve, Gauteng on 23 June 2015. This monitoring visit will focus on initiatives and interventions implemented to improve the lives of our youth and empower them to better participate in the economy of our country.Cabinet calls on young people to take advantage of opportunities offered by government programmes such as the Community Works Programme, which demonstrates how partnerships make a difference to community infrastructure and services, and also grows work opportunities into sustainable jobs due to the transfer and development of skills.Through the National Youth Development Agency, more young people are also being brought into the mainstream economy through their programmes that provide support to young entrepreneurs.4.2.    South Africa will join the continental-wide celebrations on 23 June 2015 to mark Africa Public Service Day under the theme:  The Role of Public Services in Women Empowerment, Innovation and Accessible Service Delivery . The NDP also identified enhancing the capability of the State as being critical to achieving Vision 2030. Since 1994 the country has also made great strides with the representation of women in senior management positions in the Public Service, which was at 39.8 per cent in March 2014.4.3.    Cabinet calls on all South Africans to join government on World Refugee Day, 20 June 2015, in reaffirming the country s international commitment to treat all refugees with dignity. As a signatory to the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention and as a country that cherishes human rights, we have an obligation to protect the basic rights of refugees within our borders. In many instances these are vulnerable men, women and children who have been forced to flee their homelands and have done so with great courage, strength and determination.4.4.    The Department of Home Affairs, together with other government departments and agencies, will launch Operation Pyramid on 19 June 2015 at Skukuza, Mpumalanga under the theme:  Working together for safe and secure borders . Operation Pyramid will better coordinate and align government s and its agencies  border projects, programmes and interventions. This transitional initiative will be operational until the scheduled establishment of the Border Management Agency in 2017. The secure, effective and efficient management of the cross-border movement of people and goods will be done in a manner that is consistent with the country s national development priorities.4.5.    The 60th anniversary of the Freedom Charter, which will be marked on 26 June 2015, will be used to demonstrate progress made towards realising its ideals, and to show alignment between government policies and this historic document. The Freedom Charter is a foundation on which our world acclaimed Constitution is based; today it gives effect to the country we are building through our policies and programmes.5.

Creativity and Innovation are key economic drivers in a country.  Young people must also explore opportunities that are available at Technical and Vocational Education Training colleges situated across the country in addition to universities, which include the newly established Sol T Plaatje University in the Northern Cape and the University of Mpumalanga.2. Key Cabinet decisions2.1 Cabinet ratified the decision to designate the Maluti-A-Phofung Industrial Development Zone (MAP IDZ) at Tshiame (Industriqwa-1A), Harrismith, Free State Province.  It also approved the granting of Operator Permit for this zone to the Free State Development CorporatioThe MAP IDZ designation will establish a logistics-orientated platform (Logistics Hub) 10 kilometers outside of Harrismith (the old Industriqwa site), primarily to service the automotive, light manufacturing, agro-processing and distribution/ logistics sectors.2.2 Cabinet approved that South Africa joins the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The Bank focuses on Asian and Oceanic Region in supporting the infrastructure investments. South Africa s participation will strengthen its growing business relationships with the region and will also demonstrate solidarity with the region s development aspirations.2.3 Cabinet approved the designation of the Ministers of Justice and Correctional Services and Police as responsible for the fulfillment of the State s responsibilities in terms of section 9(2) of the Prevention and Combating of Torture of Persons Act, 2013.Both Ministers will be responsible for the development of programmes aimed at preventing and combating of torture which promotes the fundamental right to freedom and security of the person as provided for in section 12 of the Constitution.2.4 Cabinet approved submission of the Additional Protocol to the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Members States to Parliament for ratification.The Additional Protocol takes into account the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union (EU) which join later into the Protocol. The enlargement of the EU will improve SA s market access into the EU, which will lead to creation of job opportunities, fostering economic growth, and improve consumer choices. This is in line with the National Development Plan vision of creating employment, growing the economy and promotion of exports.2.5 Cabinet approved that the relevant international standards and other scientific measures be implemented with a view to ensuring adequate risk management is applied when importing cattle and bovine products.This alignment of South Africa s import requirements with international scientific guidelines, will strengthen the county s position in international trade.

Bills3.1. Cabinet approved the introduction of the Criminal Matters Amendment Bill, 2015 into Parliament.The amendments provide for changes to the laws pertaining to infrastructure-related offences such cable theft, telephone lines. Stricter provisions are provided for the granting of bail, sentencing of offenders and creating a new offence to criminalise damage to essential infrastructure caused by tampering or interfering with the functioning of basic services through criminal activity.The bill once passed will ensures that mechanisms are put in place to safeguard infrastructure, in which much needed public investment is placed, to ensure that the country meets its economic growth targets and increases employment.3.2. Cabinet approved the introduction of the revised Promotion and Protection of Investment Bill, 2015 into Parliament.The Bill reaffirms that South Africa remains open to foreign investment, provides adequate security and protection to all investors, and preserves the sovereign right of the South African Government to pursue developmental and transformational public policy objectives.This is in support of the National Development Plan s (NDP) objective of promoting investment and export growth to stimulate sustainable growth and development in South Africa.3.3. Cabinet approved publication of the Copyright Amendment Bill, 2015 in the Government Gazette for wider consultation.The Bill amends the Copyright Act, No 98 of 1978 and the Performers Protection Act, No 11 of 1967, which are outdated as they do not consider developments at multi-lateral level nor do they have provisions that deal with digital issues.The Bill addresses the licensing of copyright work/ material in relation to commissioned work to prevent commercial exploitation.

We call on all public servants to recommit themselves to meet the needs of all South Africans.6. South Africa s position on the ICC matterCabinet, decided that it would review South Africa s participation in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, for a number of reasons.South Africa was always a staunch supporter of the establishment of the International Criminal Court and one of the first signatories of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. It remains committed to a system of international justice  to ensure that the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole must not go unpunished and that their effective prosecution must be ensured by taking measures at the national level and by enhancing international cooperation. South Africa will continue to promote and encourage regional and international initiatives to deal with such crimes.South Africa is a member of the Assembly of States Parties established by Article 112(1) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.South Africa is also a member of the United Nations, the African Union and other international bodies. It takes its international responsibilities and obligations very seriously.South Africa plays a significant role on the African continent and in various continental bodies.  It also hosts the Pan African Parliament. South Africa s former Minister of Home Affairs is the chairperson of the African Union Commission.South Africa is involved in peace keeping missions in many African countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. South Africa is also actively involved in ensuring that the fragile peace process underway in Sudan and South Sudan holds, in the interests of the people of those sovereign states and other sovereign countries and the African continent.South Africa is regarded internationally as an honest and reliable peace broker with about 3000 South African troops involved in such peace keeping missions under the auspices of the AU and the UN.South Africa promotes cooperation between South Africa and other countries and integrated development on the continent. South Africa uses the African Renaissance and International Co-operation Fund to, amongst other things, enhance the promotion of democracy, good governance and the prevention and resolution of conflict.South Africa invests a great deal of its financial, military, technical and human resources towards achieving peace, security and prosperity on the African continent. The benefits of these investments are slowly being realised in the countries in which South Africa is active. These countries include Sudan and South Sudan.Despite being a member of the Assembly of State Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, South Africa has to balance its obligations to the ICC with its obligations to the African Union and its obligations to individual states, including those in Africa, in terms of the international treaties which it has concluded.South Africa notes that even Permanent Members of the Security Council which are not signatories to the Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court may participate fully in discussions on the ICC and referrals by the Security Council of a situation in a country to the ICC.Those countries have taken steps to ensure that their officials and military personnel will not be subjected to the jurisdiction of the ICC.South Africa also notes the contradictions in various articles in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court on indemnity for Heads of States.Article 27 provides as follows:    Irrelevance of official capacity1. This Statute shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity. In particular, official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.2.  Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person.At first glance, this article confers the ICC with jurisdiction over anyone, irrespective of that person s official status.However, Article 98 provides as follows:    Cooperation with respect to waiver of immunity and consent to surrender.1.  The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that third State for the waiver of the immunity.2.  The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.   Article 98(2) is significant and unambiguous. It clearly states that the ICC may not request the surrender of a person by the requested State, if that would result in the requested state breaching its international obligations, unless the ICC itself can first obtain the cooperation of the sending State. In other words, the Article 98(2) places an obligation on the ICC to assist countries to execute warrants of arrest.It is abundantly clear that the ICC was aware that South Africa may have difficulties in executing the warrant of arrest for President Al-Bashir, because of its international obligations.The ICC had on 28 May 2015, already, invited South Africa to hold consultations with it regarding the execution of the warrant of arrest in accordance with Article 97 which provides in clear and unequivocal terms that where a State Party receives a request in relation to which it identifies problems which may impede or prevent the execution of the request, that State shall consult with the Court without delay in order to resolve the matter.Such problems may include the fact that execution of the request in its current form would require the requested State to breach a pre-existing treaty obligation undertaken with respect to another State.The ICC must have been aware that South Africa would, in the execution of the warrant, breach its existing treaty obligations with the AU. That must be the only plausible reason why the ICC had invited South Africa to consult with it.Having extended an invitation to South Africa to consult with it, the ICC had a duty to consult in good faith with South Africa and to assist it to comply with its obligations to the ICC and the AU.South Africa accepted the invitation by the ICC to consult with it in terms of Article 97. In fact, South Africa had a number of issues with the validity of and the execution of the warrants of arrest and South Africa s international obligations which arise from its membership of the AU.South Africa is obliged to give effect to a decision taken by the AU at Sirte in Libya on 3 July 2009 that its members must not cooperate with the ICC, pursuant to the provisions of Article 98 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court until the Security Council has considered the request by the AU. The AU has requested the Security Council to defer its decision to refer the situation in Darfur to the ICC for investigation.That request has not been acted upon yet. The AU had made the request in terms of Article 16 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, as the AU believes that the involvement of the ICC in the matter will pose a threat to peace and security on the African continent.South Africa has a particular interest in the decision of the AU because of South Africa s involvement in the peace process in Sudan and South Sudan. Both countries have given South Africa various undertakings regarding the peace process. If the peace process fails, the consequences for the people of those countries and the African continent would be calamitous.South Africa holds discussions with both Sudan and South Sudan regularly and has obtained assurances from both parties with regard to the peace process.South Africa accepted the invitation by the ICC to consult with it in terms of Article 97 in good faith and hoped for a constructive, fruitful and meaningful discussion on the difficulties experienced by South Africa in executing the warrant of arrest.An initial meeting was held with the ICC on 12 June 2015. That meeting was attended by the South African Ambassador and the legal counsel to the ambassador. At that meeting the Ambassador stressed that he was unable to deal with the technical and legal issues involved and wanted to arrange another meeting at which people who could deal with those issues would be present.A second meeting, for that purpose, was scheduled to take place on Monday, 15 June 2015. On that date, the actual consultations in terms of Article 97 were due to take place. However, the ICC sought an earlier meeting and such a meeting was arranged for Sunday 14 June 2015 at 12h30. However, late on the night of Saturday, 13 June 2015, the Prosecutor of the ICC made an urgent application to the ICC in the following terms:  Prosecutor s Urgent Request for an Order clarifying whether Article 97 Consultations with South Africa have concluded and that South Africa is under an Obligation to Immediately Arrest and Surrender Omar Al Bashir. The Prosecutor made the Urgent Request to the ICC, without giving any notice whatsoever to South Africa. The Prosecutor asked that details of the Urgent Request remain confidential, but that the decision of the ICC is made public.The ICC heard the matter immediately and issued its Decision.  In effect the ICC, without hearing South Africa, decided that the Article 97 consultations had ended and that South Africa was under an obligation to arrest and surrender President Omar Al-Bashir. That decision was made, as already mentioned, without any notice to South Africa.South Africa as a State Party to the Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court and as a member of the Assembly of State Parties was entitled to notice of the Prosecutor s Urgent Request to the ICC and to be heard on the matter, especially as consultations had been arranged.South Africa s sovereignty as a nation also suggests that it is entitled to be treated equally and with respect, irrespective of to the circumstances. It would appear that the ICC had not extended the invitation to South Africa to consult with it in terms of Article 97 in good faith and in a serious and sincere effort to assist South Africa. South Africa has, therefore, decided to review its participation in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.Two articles in the Rome Statute are important for considering the position South Africa should take regarding its future cooperation with the ICC.These are articles 119 and 127.ARTICLE 119Settlement of disputes1.  Any dispute concerning the judicial functions of the Court shall be settled by the decision of the Court.2.  Any other dispute between two or more States Parties relating to the interpretation or application of this Statute which is not settled through negotiations within three months of their commencement shall be referred to the Assembly of States Parties.The Assembly may itself seek to settle the dispute or may make recommendations on further means of settlement of the dispute, including referral to the International Court of Justice in conformity with the Statute of that Court.Article 119 deals with two situations:Firstly, disputes concerning the judicial functions of the ICC; and secondly, any dispute between two or more State Parties relating to the interpretation or application of the Rome Statute.In relation to the first above, South Africa may well have a dispute with the ICC regarding the Decision which it made pursuant to the Prosecutor s Urgent Request for an Order clarifying whether Article 97 Consultations with South Africa have concluded and that South Africa is under an Obligation to Immediately Arrest and Surrender President Omar Al Bashir.South Africa will enter into formal negotiations with the ICC on the matter with the view to understand the ICC s reasoning and how it interprets Article 97.South Africa also wants to understand, from the ICC, what its obligations are in terms of Article 98(2) to a requested State which cannot in violation of an international obligation execute a warrant of arrest.South Africa also intends raising the matter at the next meeting of the Assembly of State Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Given the complexity of the technical and legal concerns which we have, South Africa will also consider referring the matter to the International Court of Justice for a decision on the matter.Article 97 had never been used before by the ICC. This was the first time a State Party had been invited by the ICC to consult with it regarding the difficulties which it may have in executing a warrant of arrest which may result in the State Party breaching its international obligations. The ICC was required to take the matter seriously and both parties were obliged to negotiate in good faith.South Africa, may as a last resort also consider withdrawing from the ICC. Such a decision will only be taken when South Africa has exhausted all the remedies available to it in terms of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the Charter of the United Nations and other international law instruments.Article 127 deals with the withdrawal from the ICC and provides amongst others.1. A State Party may, by written notification addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, withdraw from this Statute. The withdrawal shall take effect one year after the date of receipt of the notification, unless the notification specifies a later date.South Africa will enter into immediate discussion with the African Union and its member states on how African dispute resolution mechanisms can be implemented without delay  to ensure that the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole must not go unpunished and that their effective prosecution must be ensured by taking measures at the national level and by enhancing international cooperation. More particularly, South Africa will enter into multilateral and bilateral negotiations with other African countries to expedite the reform of the African Court on Human and Peoples Rights and other regional tribunals. This will ensure that serious crimes against humanity can be promptly and efficiently dealt with by these bodies and that a complementarity scheme exists whereby such crimes may be prosecuted by either the ICC or the regional bodies.South Africa will shortly make arrangements to enter into formal discussions with the ICC on the matters which are of concern to it.South Africa will prepare a report in respect of its interaction with the ICC in terms of Article 97 and the difficulties which it experienced in terms of Article 98(2) and submit that to the next meeting of the Assembly of State Parties.South Africa will also propose amendments to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court to clarify and amplify the consulting and cooperation obligations of the ICC towards such States.Engagements with the AU and African states will also commence.  Government will appoint a team of Ministers who will immediately start the engagements with the ICC, the AU and African states.7.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 12 August 2015,13 Aug 2015,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-12-august-2015-13-aug-2015-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-12-august-2015-13-aug-2015-0000,"1. Implementation of key government programmes1.1. Cabinet welcomes the progress of Project Mikondzo, a service-delivery initiative aimed at expanding the reach of social services in the poorest communities of the country. This was demonstrated at De Doorns in the Western Cape, where aid is being provided to 4 021 families whose breadwinners are mostly seasonal farmworkers. The assistance include, among other things, the supply of seed and seedlings for family gardens and funding for the establishment of community-based organisations and cooperatives. The Department of Social Development is also using De Doorns to develop a policy on seasonal workers.In addition, the South African Social Security Agency rolled out an extensive Social Relief of Distress programme to provide food and other necessities such as school uniforms for children from indigent families. A grant of R1 083 160 from the National Development Agency supports 11 non-centre based Early Childhood Development (ECD) playgroups, with 975 children now attending ECD centres in the area and 789 of them benefiting from government s ECD subsidy.1.2. Cabinet commends the ongoing successes of Operation Fiela, the most recent being in the Northern Cape where the integrated operation by the South African Police Service (SAPS), government departments, and provincial and municipal law-enforcement agencies went further in ensuring that people are and feel safe. The Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on Migration will hold a media briefing next week to provide a detailed update.1.3. Cabinet commends unions and mining houses for working with government to reviltalise the mining sector, which is the backbone of our economy and urges all parties to implement commitments. Government, together with business and labour, have been striving to improve decent   housing and living conditions in mining towns. Overall R18 billion has been dedicated to ongoing work in distressed mining communities, the bulk of which is from government with mining companies contributing approximately a third of the funding.1.4. Cabinet approved the inclusion of the Security Cluster Ministers to the Inter-ministerial committee (IMC) on Immigration which was announced by President Zuma.  The IMC, led by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, will examine and solve the potential and unintended consequences of the new immigration regulations on various sectors, including tourism and investment. The IMC will comprise of the Ministers of Tourism; Home Affairs; Trade and Industry; Social Development; Small Business Development, and the Security Cluster.2. Cabinet s position on key issues in the environment2.1. Cabinet welcomed the Women s Day celebrations that took place in Sasolburg in the Free State under the theme:  Women United in Moving South Africa Forward . Thousands of women gathered at the Harry Gwala Stadium in Sasolburg to recognise the important role that political activism by women played during the struggle for liberation against colonialism and apartheid.Cabinet calls on all sectors of society to sustain the theme of Women s Month and to continue working towards ensuring that all women, particularly the girl child, are empowered and freed from societal prejudices so that we can address gender equality in the country.In addition, President Zuma also released a first-of-its-kind report on the Status of Women in South Africa. The report notes, great strides made in the country since 1994 to improve the status of women. This report was compiled by the Department of Women after hosting dialogues across the country between March and June this year (2015). This report serves as a baseline document for the promotion of women s socio-economic empowerment, gender equality and human rights.Government will use the remainder of the month to profile women achievers and their participation in the economy, especially in areas where they are under-represented. These include the Women in Science Awards (13 August) and Women in Water and Sanitation Awards (23 August).2.2. Cabinet commends the Proteas for making South Africa proud at the Netball World Cup in Sydney, Australia. The South African team is on the verge of qualifying for the semi-finals of the World Cup after having played rigorous and tough games thus far.According to the International Netball Federation, South Africa is now ranked number five in the world. Cabinet calls on all South Africans to support the Proteas as they continue in the conquest at the World Cup.2.3. Cabinet has joined President Zuma in conveying its condolences to the families, friends and colleagues of the murdered members of the SAPS. Such senseless killings should be condemned by all South Africans.Policemen and policewomen are central in protecting communities from criminal elements in our society. The senseless murders not only rob the country and society of law-enforcement officers, but they also deprive families of husbands, wives, brothers, sisters and parents.Cabinet calls on those with information about these senseless murders to come forward and work with law-enforcement agencies to ensure that those responsible are arrested and face the full might of the law.2.4. Cabinet congratulates Team South Africa on their outstanding performance at the 16th FINA (International Swimming Federation) World Championship in Kazan, Russia during which they won two gold and three silver medals.3. Key Cabinet decisions3.1. Cabinet approved the release for public consultation of the Green Paper on National Rail Policy, which addresses freight and passenger rail transportation. This policy, which is aligned to the work of the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission, enables the revitalisation of the railway industry through strategic investment-led policy interventions that are aligned to the National Development Plan (NDP).The aim is to create an efficient transport system that is able to compete locally and internationally, and reduce transportation costs. This will encourage the use of appropriate technologies to increase productivity and acquisition of much-needed skills in the economy. It also improves rural access, increased mobility and job creation.3.2. Cabinet approved the circulation of the  National Skills Development Strategy and Sector Education and Training Authorities beyond 2016 within the context of an integrated, differentiated post-school education and training system  document for public consultation.The document addresses the efficiency and effectiveness of skills development institutions and their integration into the broader post-school education and training system.In particular, it proposes for the next National Skills Development Strategy to prioritise occupations that have been identified as being in high demand for the implementation of national priority programmes. It also addresses the efficiency and effectiveness of governance matters of sector education and training authorities in the issuing of grants for priority occupations.3.3. Cabinet approved the issuing of a permanent operating licence to Transnet Ports Terminal to operate the manganese container terminal at the Port of Ngqura, located on the east coast of South Africa, 20 kilometres north east of Port Elizabeth and midway between Durban and Cape Town. This is in line with government priorities relating to Operation Phakisa on growing the Oceans Economy. This will result in relocating manganese operations from the ports of Port Elizabeth and Saldanha to the Port of Ngqura.3.4. Cabinet approved for South Africa to accede to the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea, 2010.The convention ensures compensation for damage to persons and property, cost of clean-up and reinstatement measures, and economic losses resulting from the maritime transport of hazardous and noxious substances that may pollute the ocean. South Africa will be able to access the fund to assist in hazardous and noxious substances incidents once all the parliamentary processes to domesticate this convention have been completed.4. Bills4.1. Cabinet approved the submission of the Films and Publications Amendment Bill, 2015 to Parliament. The Bill amends the Films and Publications Act, 1996 (Act 65 of 1996). The amendments provide for technological advances, especially online and social-media platforms, in order to protect children from being exposed to disturbing and harmful media content in all platforms (physical and online).The Bill strengthens the duties imposed on mobile networks and Internet service providers to protect the public and children during usage of their services. The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa will not issue licences or renewals without confirmation from the Film and Publication Board of full compliance with its legislation.5. Upcoming events5.1. President Zuma will attend the 35th Ordinary Summit of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Heads of State from 17 to 18 August 2015 in Gaborone, Botswana. At the summit, the President will hand over the chairpersonship of the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation. In this role, South Africa has led six SADC Electoral Observation Missions, which certified that all the elections were peaceful and credible.5.2. Deputy President Ramaphosa will undertake a Working Visit to Japan from 24 to 25 August 2015. This visit includes a courtesy call to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and participation in the South Africa-Japan External Trade Organisation Business Seminar.Cabinet welcomes the working visit to Japan, which will strengthen the friendship and mutual understanding that exists between the two countries. South Africa and Japan also share similar views on the importance of multilateralism and the need to reform the United Nations (UN) Security Council and UN system at the 70th UN General Assembly meeting next month.5.3. President Zuma will undertake a Presidential Imbizo to Eersterust, Pretoria on 21 August 2015 to address issues related to substance abuse. The National Drug Master Plan, 2013-2017, coordinates government s efforts in the fight against alcohol and substance abuse.Cabinet calls on communities to work with government and law-enforcement agencies to rid our society of substance abuse, which is the cause of numerous social problems, including violence against women and child abuse. Parents and guardians have a critical role to play in ensuring that children are protected and nurtured.5.4. Cabinet welcomes the opening of the newly upgraded Makgatho Lewanika Mandela Primary School in Mvezo in the Eastern Cape on 25 August 2015 by President Zuma.The school is part of government s ongoing work to restore dignity to learners and provide schools in rural areas with more modern facilities. Through the Department of Basic Education s Accelerated Schools Infrastructure Delivery Initiative (ASIDI), government has eradicated a number of poorly constructed schools and created a more conducive learning environment. So far, ASIDI has completed 116 schools and provided water to 499 schools, sanitation to 425 and electricity to 298.5.5. Deputy President Ramaphosa will attend the International Federation of Library Associations  World Library and Information Congress taking place at the Cape Town International Convention Centre from 15 to 21 August 2015 under the theme:  Dynamic Libraries: Access, Development and Transformation . The congress coincides with government s roll-out of more than 1 000 school libraries across the country between 18 July 2015 and 18 July 2016 to encourage more learners to read. The Department of Basic Education is also lobbying various private business organisations and non-governmental organisations to support the campaign by donating books and establishing libraries, among other things.Cabinet appeals to parents and teachers to endeavour to make books accessible to young people, and calls on communities to donate books and establish reading clubs because a reading nation is a winning nation.5.6. Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom will launch Tourism Month on 16 August 2015 at Euphoria Golf Estate, Mookgophong in Limpopo under the theme:  A Million new opportunities Await , which is derived from World Tourism Day (27 September) theme:  1 Billion Tourists   1 Billion Opportunities . The international and local themes aim to make tourists aware of the importance of responsible tourism. As part of this, tourists are encouraged to respect cultures, protect heritage, save energy and water, and most importantly, buy regional products to support local jobs.Cabinet encourages South Africans to explore our fascinating and beautiful country, and by doing so help maintain jobs and support local products.5.7. The departments of sport and recreation and of women have partnered with G-Sport in honouring South African women who participate in sport.  The Department of Sport and Recreation and G-Sport will bestow honours on deserving women athletes and administrators who strove against all forms of oppression to raise the flag of this country.  The department remains conscious of the work needed in advancing the agenda for equality of all women involved in sport, both in administration and in participation. While the department recognises that more work still needs to be done in this regard, it is committed to joining hands with those who are determined to make a difference in the plight of women.5.8. Cabinet encourages all South Africans to nominate recipients for the 2016 National Orders Awards, which are the highest awards that South Africa bestows on its citizens and eminent foreign nationals who have contributed towards the advancement of democracy and who have made a significant impact on improving the lives of South Africans.The six National Orders are the Order of Mendi for Bravery, the Order of Ikhamanga, the Order of the Baobab, the Order of Luthuli, the Order of Mapungubwe, and the Order of the Companions of OR Tambo.The closing date for nominations is 31 August 2015.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 26 August 2015,28 Aug 2015,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-26-august-2015-28-aug-2015-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-26-august-2015-28-aug-2015-0000,"1. Current issues1.1. Cabinet welcomed Unit 6 of Medupi Power Station in Lephalale, Limpopo coming into full commercial operation and contributing 800 megawatts (MW) power into the national grid. The Medupi Power Station Project is a greenfield coal-fired power plant comprising six units rated in total at 4 764 MW installed capacity. President Jacob Zuma will launch this unit on 30 August 2015.Construction of the Medupi Power Station started in May 2007 and all six units are expected to be operational in the first half of 2019. Once completed, it will be the fourth largest coal-fired plant and the largest dry-cooled power station in the world. The planned operational life of the power station is 50 years.Unit 6 was first synchronised to the national grid on 2 March this year and has been supplying electricity to the national grid intermittently whilst undergoing regular optimisation tests. During this period Unit 6 has been able to alleviate pressure on the national electricity system, helping to either avoid load-shedding altogether or minimise its severity. The unit s commercial operation has been achieved, well within the normally stipulated period of six months after first synchronisation.The commercial operation of Unit 6 of the Medupi Power Station is a critical milestone in our effort to build new generating capacity.1.2. Cabinet further appreciated the current constraints the country still faces on the power supply. While load-shedding is regrettable, Eskom is committed to perform the necessary maintenance to improve the long-term health of our plants with reasonable disruptions. Next Monday (31 August), Unit 2 of the Koeberg Power Station in the Western Cape will be shut down for planned maintenance.1.3. The unit is expected to return to service after three months. The scheduled shutdown of Koeberg Unit 2 is part of Eskom s overall maintenance programme for its fleet of power stations. Every 16 to 18 months, each of the two units at Koeberg is shut down for refueling, inspection and maintenance. The routine shutdowns are scheduled so as to avoid having both units out of service at the same time and to avoid the winter months in each year.1.4. Whilst we continue to make progress in improving our electricity generation capacity, Cabinet calls on South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly.2. Summit of Heads of State and Government2.1. Cabinet welcomed the outcomes from the 35th Ordinary Southern African Development Community (SADC) Summit of Heads of State and Government, wherein President Zuma led the South African delegation.The summit adopted the revised Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan 2015-2020. The summit further signed three agreements/protocols that will enable the region to address its key challenges of unemployment and poverty eradication in a sustainable way.Agreement amending the Protocol on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation (Protocol) and Agreement amending the Treaty of the SADC (Treaty). These agreements will allow the Inter-State Defence and Security Committee of the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation to serve as a coordinating forum for the Chiefs of Corrections and Prisons in Southern Africa.Declaration on Youth Development and Empowerment draws attention to the urgency of youth development and empowerment in the context of regional cooperation, integration, development and peace, and security in the region.Protocol on Trade Services to liberalise intra-SADC trade in services with a view to creating a single market for services in the region.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 9 December 2015,11 Dec 2015,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-9-december-2015-11-dec-2015-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-9-december-2015-11-dec-2015-0000,"1. Implementation of key government programmes1.1. Cabinet welcomed the signing of 26 agreements to the value of R94 billion during the recent State Visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping. The signed agreements included R12 billion to build a car-manufacturing plant in South Africa, a US$500 million loan facility to Eskom for infrastructure development and a US$2.5 billion funding guarantee for Transnet from the China Development Bank.  As part of the 2nd Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), President Xi Jinping pledged US$60 billion for development in Africa. The adoption of a new Declaration and Plan of Action (2016-2018) at FOCAC consolidates the growing mutual partnership between Africa and China, which will unlock new trade and investment opportunities to help stimulate economic growth.The economy further received an economic boost with South Africa s BMW Group announcing an investment of R6 billion at its plant in Rosslyn, Pretoria, which bears testament to the important partnership that exists between business and government, and the role that business is playing in the development of the economy. 1.2. On Tuesday, 8 December, President Zuma bestowed National Orders to South African citizens and eminent foreign nationals who have contributed to the upliftment of humanity. The National Orders are a moment of great reflection, celebration and pride for our people. They celebrate human achievement, human sacrifice and human endeavours that make our country a better place. We salute the recipients of the 2015 National Orders. 1.3. Cabinet appeals to all South Africans to use water sparingly. This is in support of a number of measures taken to alleviate the water shortages, which have been exacerbated by the heatwave the country has experienced in the past weeks. Whilst the recent rainfalls in some parts of the country provided some relief, the country s water shortage remains a real challenge and requires all of us to use water sparingly and responsibly. 1.4. Cabinet expressed its appreciation to all South Africans for participating in this year s 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children campaign, which ended yesterday. Recent research indicates high numbers of new HIV infections, particularly among young women and girls in Africa between 15 and 24 years of age. South Africans are encouraged to take forward their activism into everyday action as part of the #365 Days Campaign of No Violence Against Women and Children and the #CountMeIn campaign that unfolds throughout the year ahead.Through the #365 Days Campaign and #CountMeIn, the country needs to continue mobilising members of society, especially men, to join hands with government in dealing with this scourge. It is the responsibility of the nation, both individually and collectively, to stop the spread of the virus by taking care of our own health and that of others. 1.5. Cabinet has appreciated the progress that has been made by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in developing a bio-manufacturing process for HIV antibodies. This brings the health industry a step closer to an economically viable preventative treatment. Whilst the country still struggles to find the cure for HIV and AIDS, South Africans are still expected to practice safe sex and observe the ABC (Abstain, Be faithful and Condomise) principles of preventing new infections. 1.6. Cabinet commends all learners, students, teachers, lecturers, schools and institutions of higher learning on concluding a successful academic year, despite the challenges experienced during the year.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 13 January 2016,14 Jan 2016,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-special-cabinet-meeting-14-jan-2016-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-special-cabinet-meeting-14-jan-2016-0000,"1. Economy1.1.Cabinet met to deliberate on the state of the economy and budget related matters. Cabinet noted a number of factors impacting on the economy of the country.The global outlook has deteriorated in recent months. Slower global growth reflects, in particular, weaker performance and higher risks in several important developing countries, including China.The welcomed recovery expected in the USA is likely to result in rising global interest rates. Depressed trade volumes and turbulence in global capital markets underscore the need for nations to build resilience and act cautiously in the period ahead.Cabinet further noted that there were some benefits from the low price of crude oil.  As a major commodity exporter, South Africa is concerned about the continued weakness in commodity prices.Government continues to build on the country s diverse economic structure, and export earnings continue to depend to a great extent on metals and semi processed raw materials.The fall in commodity prices is unlikely to reverse speedily. This will have sustained consequences for the South African economy and many of our partners on the African continent.The depreciation of the Rand over the last few years offers much better prospects for export growth and, combined with a lower global oil price, has helped to relieve pressure on the current account. However, weaker growth in South Africa s major trading partners has meant subdued demand for South African products abroad.The global environment is regarded as particularly challenging for emerging markets, with lower commodity prices and tightening of monetary policy in the USA putting pressure on capital flows and growth expectations. This has translated into significant volatility in capital markets.The South African Rand, which is amongst the most traded emerging market currencies, has been particularly hard-hit in recent weeks.In this difficult global context, in which all economies face difficult challenges, Cabinet reaffirmed the need for government to intervene strategically and more decisively to restore the momentum of economic growth.1.2. The National Development Plan provides for these interventions. Government will reach out to social partners, particularly business and organised labour, to build consensus on the collective actions required to stabilise the economy, build confidence, raise the level of investment and return South Africa to a path of inclusive economic growth. The State of the Nation Address on 11 February will take account of this work.1.3. Cabinet endorsed stronger measures to restore a sustainable fiscal path, taking account of the weakened outlook for the global economy and its domestic consequences. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan will unveil the measures when he presents the national budget on 24 February 2016.2. Higher Education fundingCabinet approved amendments to national budget allocations that would shift resources to fund universities without breaching previously announced spending limits.President Jacob Zuma and Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande recently indicated that these allocations would cover the zero-fee increment agreed for the current academic year, clear accumulated debt owed by the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) students and prevent the accumulation of such debt over the medium term.  These intervention measures are a response to a number of consultations which started in October 2015 and are still continuing. The Minister of Higher Education and training  with his management team has held a number of meetings with SASCO leadership, all Student Representative Councils, University South Africa Forum , South African Union of Students, the CEO s of SETA s , Higher Education Transformation Network and the Parliamentary committee responsible for higher education.The President also met with the leadership of the students and has announced the setting up of the Commission to look into the issues raised in Higher Education. These engagements are still continuing as we believe as government we do want to work towards finding a lasting solution. The demands of the students are in line with the objectives of the programme of government in respect of education.2.1.1. As an immediate measure, R2.33 billion has been allocated to resolve the shortfall in operational funding for universities as a result of the agreement on a 0% fee increment for 2016.2.1.2. In the 2016/17 financial year, government has reprioritized R2.543 billion of State funding to be allocated to NSFAS to provide loans to assist 71 753 identified students who qualified for NSFAS funding but were either partially or not funded at all over the past three academic years. This means that these deserving students will not be prevented from continuing with their studies for owing universities outstanding fees.2.1.3. A further R2.039 billion will be allocated to NSFAS in the 2016/17 financial year to support unfunded or under-funded students still in the university system in 2016 to complete their qualifications.  These funds are additional to the R10 billion that NSFAS will administer in the 2016 academic year.Government is committed to providing post-school education for all academically deserving students that is free at the point of delivery for the poor and the working class, within fiscally sustainable limits. Cabinet calls on students, workers, academics and university administrators to work together with government to achieve this goal. Actions that disrupt learning or create unreasonable and practically unachievable expectations are counterproductive. Violence and intimidation are not acceptable.2.2. Cabinet calls on all South Africans to recognize that there are challenging circumstances in the period ahead. Global economic conditions have weakened. The impact of lower commodity prices is already being felt in South Africa. Domestic constraints such as insufficient electricity supply are still with us. The severe drought is causing hardships in several provinces.Cabinet is confident that South Africans remain as a resilient nation that knows the value of working together in peace and harmony. The recent exposure of individuals with racist s beliefs has strengthen our collective commitment to build a nonracial, nonsexist and prosperous society.  3. AppointmentsCabinet approved the following appointments:3.1. Mr Shonisani Mathews Munzhedzi as Deputy Director-General (DDG): Biodiversity and Conservation in the Department of Environmental Affairs.3.2.

This   initiative will further improve in an efficient and cost effective manner the quality of the services we give to the public.2.6.

That means that from that date provident fund benefits and pension fund benefits will be treated equally in that provident fund members will on retirement be permitted to take one third of their provident fund benefits in cash as a lump sum payment and the remaining two thirds of their benefits will have to be used by them to purchase annuities. The very same provision applies to members of pension funds currently.The changes in the legislation affect high-end earners and all other persons who belong to provident funds.A number of organisations and individuals have expressed concern about the implementation of the new changes and have made representations to the government about the implementation. It is apparent that despite the extensive consultation processes which were embarked upon before the law was passed that those concerns still exist and that those concerns have to be addressed urgently to ensure that when the law commences the changes to the provident fund benefits will be implemented smoothly and efficiently.For that reason, Cabinet has decided to table a legislative amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Act as a matter of urgency to postpone the commencement date from 1 March 2016 to 1 March 2018 to allow for further consultations with all key stakeholders. Those consultations may result in further amendment to the laws. An Amendment Bill will be tabled in Parliament within the next few days.6. Condolences6.1. Cabinet conveys condolences on the recent passing away of His Grace Bishop Glayton Modise of the International Pentecostal Holiness Church. Bishop Modise led the congregation with over three million members across southern Africa, following the death of his father and the founder of the church, His Grace Comforter Frederick Modise in 1996.6.2. Cabinet also conveys its deepest sympathies on the recent passing away of the former Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN) Chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali. He took office in 1992 at the time of growing influence for the UN following its decisive role in the Gulf war, serving one five year term. He died at a Cairo hospital on Tuesday aged 93. He will be remembered for his contribution to peace and democracy.  7. Congratulations7.1. Cabinet congratulates Mr Kevin Govender from the Cape Town-based Office of Astronomy for Development and the International Astronomical Union who will be jointly awarded the prestigious Edinburgh Medal for 2016 for establishing the Office of Astronomy for Development in Cape Town. Govender is the first South African to receive this prestigious award for science and technology achievements which contribute to the understanding and well-being of humanity.Cabinet commends 16-year-old ballet dancer Leroy Mokgatle who won an Audience Favourite award and a scholarship at the Prix de Lausanne International Ballet Competition in Switzerland.

This appointment is in recognition of the sterling leadership displayed by our President in the international arena.The commission will stimulate the creation of new employment opportunities in the health sector across all countries, especially in least developed ones. This also strengthens the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which will go a long way to addressing the triple challenge of unemployment, poverty and inequality.1.5. Cabinet welcomes the launch of the 2016 National Community Survey in Mamelodi, Pretoria by the Minister in The Presidency Jeff Radebe and the Statistician-General Pali Lehohla. This year s survey is being undertaken under the theme:  The South African I know, the home I understand  and is targeting more than 1,5 million households   the biggest so far compared to the one held five years ago that sampled only 300 000 households. The survey will be undertaken in April and the results made available by the end of June 2016.1.6.

Cabinet invites South Africans to comment on the National Action Plan to combat Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance (2016-2021) before 30 June 2016. The plan provides the basis for a public policy against racial discrimination that will assist in giving effect to our international human rights obligations.4.3.

By casting your vote you have taken a step towards making your voice heard in the decisions that affect you and your community. Local government is in your hands!5.3. Cabinet condemns the violent student protests, which have disrupted studies at some universities and led to the destruction of property. These protests deprive deserving students the opportunity to further their studies and impacts upon their right to higher education. Government has opened channels of communication with all higher-education stakeholders for discussions and dialogues. This has resulted in the restoration of normality and the promotion of social cohesion in our universities that seeks to find solutions to the medium- to long-term challenges linked to the transformation of the sector as described in the resolutions of the 2015 Higher Education Transformation Summit.Cabinet supports the efforts by law-enforcement agencies to ensure that the culture of learning is restored, and that property and the rights of individuals are protected. The rule of law is paramount and should be upheld at all times. Normality and calm must return in our universities so that the academic programmes can continue while the medium- to long-term challenges are addressed.    Cabinet applauded the students who stood united against racism and anti-white chauvinism, which serves as an example that we can all work together to build on the progress and gains made in the tertiary education sector in preparation for this academic year.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 16 March 2016,17 Mar 2016,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-16-march-2016-17-mar-2016-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-16-march-2016-17-mar-2016-0000,"1. Key Cabinet decisions1.1. Cabinet assessed the Third Quarter Outcomes Progress Reports for the period October to December 2015. The reports show significant progress in the implementation of government programmes that have a direct impact on improving the lives of South Africans.The Outcomes Progress Reports provide evidence that government has made progress in achieving the targets set out in the Medium Term Strategic Framework 2014-2019. They also take us closer to realising Vision 2030, as articulated in the National Development Plan, which aims to tackle poverty, unemployment and inequality.Cabinet noted the reasonable progress that was made to achieve the key targets and outputs. Cabinet has noted that while significant progress was made in respect of most of the indicators, there are still areas that require coordinated interventions by government.2. Implementation of key government programmes2.1. Cabinet has expressed its gratitude to all South Africans who responded to the call by the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) for people to register, check their registration status and update their details on the voters  roll on the weekend of 5 and 6 March 2016. About three million people visited polling stations countrywide and 544 552 of the new registrations (78.6%) were under the age of 30, which demonstrates the willingness by South Africans to participate in building our democracy.Cabinet calls on South Africans to exercise their democratic right by registering and urges those who have registered previously to verify their voter registration details as a number of factors have led to changes in the voters  roll.2.2. The final registration weekend will take place on 9 and 10 April 2016 when all voting stations will again be open from 8:00 to 17:00. This will be the last opportunity for voters to register and update their registration details at their voting stations. However, registration is ongoing at local IEC offices during office hours from Monday to Friday, until the voters  roll for the 2016 Municipal Elections closes on the day the elections are promulgated.Cabinet condemns the violence in some areas that marred the recent registration weekend and reiterates that no person may prevent any South African from exercising their democratic right to register to vote. Cabinet further calls on all those responsible to desist from such criminal activities and for those affected to report them to law-enforcement agencies. Cabinet calls on all law-enforcement agencies to take strong action against law-breakers.2.3. President Jacob Zuma will visit Port Elizabeth on 8 April 2016 to inspect progress made in developing marine transport infrastructure as part of the country s Oceans Economy initiative. The Oceans Economy is one of the three streams of Operation Phakisa and takes the country closer to unlocking the potential of South Africa s oceans, which has the potential to contribute up to R177 billion to the gross domestic product and create over one million new jobs.2.4. Cabinet welcomes the successful conclusion of the State Visit by President Zuma to the Federal Republic of Nigeria from 8 to 9 March 2016, which enhanced existing bilateral political, economic and social ties. One of the milestones of the visit was the elevation of the Binational Commission to a Head of State level, which prioritises economic development between the two countries.Cabinet welcomes the opening of Nigeria s economy to South African companies in various sectors such as engineering, telecommunications, construction, aviation, media, hospitality, banking, entertainment, property, retail, and oil and gas exploration services. Cabinet looks forward to the increase in the number of Nigerian investments in South Africa that will promote two-way trade between the two nations.The outcomes from this engagement between two of the largest economies on the continent will integrate regional economies, thereby increasing the common market and elevating existing initiatives of economic growth and employment in Africa. This demonstrates that South Africa remains a competitive investment destination despite a troubled global economy, and will result in job opportunities and skills development for South Africans.2.5. Cabinet noted that South Africa will be participating at the 60th Session of the United Nations (UN) Commission on the Status of Women (CSW60) taking place in New York, USA from 14 to 24 March 2016 under the theme:  Women s empowerment and its link to sustainable development . The session is taking place in an important year for South Africa as it marks three important milestones, namely the 20th Anniversary of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996, 40th Anniversary of the Soweto Youth Uprising and the 60th Anniversary of the 1956 women s march.South Africa has presented a report to the UN CSW60 and this gives us an opportunity to benchmark the progress we have made since the dawn of democracy. It is important to note that since the democratic dispensation South Africa, among other things, participated in the 4th World Conference of Women in 1995, and signed the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in the same year.In line with resolution E/RES/2013/18 of the UN Economic and Social Council, South Africa is committed to continue implementing the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, which is a blueprint for women s empowerment and advancement.3. Bills3.1. Cabinet approved the submission of the Local Government: Municipal Structures Amendment Bill of 2016 to Parliament. Amendments are being made to the Local Government: Municipal Structures Act, 1998 (Act 117 of 1998), which was enacted prior to the first democratic local government elections which took place on 5 December 2000.The amendments will improve the administration of local government elections and among other changes, seek to:a) amend criteria for Category A municipalities;b) remove all references to district management areas;c) clarify the date of assumption of office by a councillor;d) determine the President must set and call the date for the municipal elections;e) allow for extension in the declaration of results of an election;f) require a municipal manager to inform the IEC of ward vacancies;g) determine that a Member of the Executive Council calls and sets the date for by-elections;h) clarify the quorum requirements for a council meeting;i) clarify the circumstances for the casting vote of a councillor presiding during a council meeting;j) increase variance of the number of voters in each ward during a council meeting; andk) increase variance of the number of voters in each ward during a demarcation to clarify the allocation of excessive seats in local municipalities.4.

Cabinet calls on all South Africans to unite against and denounce racism   be it in our homes, communities, social gatherings, workplaces or on social media. We must all work together to achieve a united, non-racial and non-sexist democracy.4.5. Members of the Executive will interact with South Africans across the country during the National Imbizo Focus Week between 4 and 10 April 2016, under the theme:  Together we move South Africa forward: Grow South Africa.  The week coincides with the Parliamentary Constituency Week and the commemoration of Freedom Month.Cabinet encourages South Africans to actively participate in these events and to engage with political principals. The Imbizo Focus Week will highlight the implementation of the Nine-Point Plan that aims to boost economic growth and create much-needed jobs. It will also profile local government successes, including achievements yielded through the local government revitalisation plan   the Back-to-Basics approach.The week will also coincide with the final registration weekend ahead of the 2016 Municipal Elections, further providing an opportunity for principals to galvanise and mobilise South Africans through voter education outreaches to register and verify their voting details.4.6. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will open the 2nd Human Resource Development Council Summit taking place at the Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand on 29 and 30 March 2016 under the theme:  Partnership for skills   A Call to Action .

National Water Week 2016 will take place from 14 to 22 March under the theme:  Water for people, water by people . The week will profile water as a human right by raising awareness of the plight of people who do not have access to clean drinkable water.The Department of Water and Sanitation is still in the process of eradicating the bucket system and has thus far eradicated 78.8% of the bucket system in formal settlements in South Africa. Seven provinces have performed excellently with an average 90% eradication. Those that have achieved total eradication in formal settlements are KwaZulu-Natal, North West, Mpumalanga and Gauteng. The Western Cape has reached 99.8% clearance. From a target of 26 120 for the Northern Cape, Eastern Cape, North West and Free State, some 11 650 systems have been completed to date.While the recent rainfall brought some relief, the impact of the drought continues to be felt in some parts of the country. South Africans must continue to use water sparingly and implement water-saving initiatives. Government has since provided R1 billion to deal with the drought crisis.Cabinet welcomes the progress being made by the five-year War on Leaks programme under the theme:  Every drop counts . The programme aims to recruit, train and deploy 15 000 young people with the minimum qualification of Grade 12 or N3 as plumbers, artisans and water agents.5. Cabinet s position on key issues in the environment5.1. Cabinet appeals to protesters to act with the utmost restraint and express their grievances within the confines of the law and the Constitution. Vandalism and damage of property goes beyond the limits of the right to protest and is the work of misguided criminal elements. Law-enforcement agencies will uphold the law by apprehending and charging those who destroy property at universities, other institutions of higher learning, in communities and during protest action.5.2. The Minister of Finance briefed Cabinet on the recent roadshows that he undertook to the US and United Kingdom with various stakeholders, including business leaders. Cabinet is committed to ensuring that the country works together to ensure that we are not downgraded.The visit offers government the opportunity to share a number of initiatives implemented to deal with challenges. These include collaborative actions to accelerate inclusive growth, measures to fast-track fiscal consolidation, speed up implementation of our R870 billion Infrastructure Investment Programme and progress made in resolving the energy constraints, including through renewable energy.Cabinet calls on all sectors to communicate all the positive programmes and interventions undertaken to safeguard our economy. It is important for all sectors to ensure that the country s economy is resilient. In this regard, Cabinet has also instructed the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Investment to fast track all key economic-related decisions. Cabinet reiterates that the resilience of the South African economy is built on sound economic fundamentals and practical policies.5.3. Cabinet noted a court case brought by the Chamber of Mines for the Mining Charter to be declared unconstitutional and void. Cabinet reiterates that the principles of the Mining Charter are aimed at transforming the mining industry to redress historical imbalances engendered by apartheid so that the industry is consistent with the changes in South Africa s overall transformation of its social, political and economic landscape. Community upliftment is also a key focus area to ensure that mining development does not exclude relevant communities.5.4. Cabinet calls on all road users, especially those travelling over the upcoming holiday period, to play their part by taking responsibility for their own safety and that of other road users. Ending the road carnage remains a national priority. Drivers must be alert, obey the rules of the road, not drink and drive, keep to the speed limit and ensure that their vehicles are roadworthy.5.5. Cabinet congratulates all the winners of the National Disability Rights Awards held on 11 March 2016.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 11 May 2016,12 May 2016,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-11-may-2016-12-may-2016-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-11-may-2016-12-may-2016-0000,"1. Implementation of Key Government Programmes1.1. Cabinet took note of the report-back by the Minister of Finance to the President, on the progress of Government s consultations with the private sector and labour on the economy. The President mandated the Minister to lead engagements with these social partners to map out a strategy and come up with measures for growing the economy and preserving the country s credit rating.Cabinet is pleased that this work has culminated in concrete initiatives that will improve the country s economic prospects. The President announced several priority initiatives on Monday, which include: (1) a joint private and public sector fund for Small Business Support, (2) addressing constraints to increasing investment in order to accelerate inclusive growth, (3) government and private sector co-investment in infrastructure drawing on experience of the successful Independent Power Producer Programme and (4) strengthening State Owned Enterprises to ensure their financial sustainability and reinforcing their role in driving development.These announcements are testament to what this country can achieve when all social partners come together to work towards the same goal.1.2. Cabinet remains confident that government s aggressive fiscal consolidation, the historic R1 trillion collection by the South African Revenue Service and the recently announced five short-term interventions, all complement the Nine Point plan so as to ensure a turn-around in our economic fortunes. The increased revenue collection by SARS will further enable Government to deliver services that will improve the quality of lives of all its citizens.1.3. Cabinet welcomes the announcement by ratings agency, Moody s Investor Services, which over the past week reaffirmed the country s credit rating at two notches above sub-investment grade. In affirming the rating, Moody s noted that South Africa was approaching a turning point after years of weak growth and the aggressive consolidation measures in the 2016 budget will stabilise government debt to GDP in the current year. All parties are agreed that collaborative efforts need to be strengthened to give impetus to the economic recovery. We also note that the Minister of Finance  work with social partners includes a credit ratings workstream that will identify potential reforms and interventions to preserve South Africa s strong capital markets and investment grade credit rating.1.4 The President appreciates the Budget Votes by respective Ministers which address the needs of all South Africans. The progress reports and plans emanating from the Departmental Budget Votes demonstrates that South Africa is a nation at work, with government leading the way, in building a better life for all.Concrete measures have been put in place to reduce the negative impact of the global economic downturn on our economy, and to prepare for robust growth when the economic cycle turns positive. We are also working hard to remove domestic impediments to growth.The budget votes also demonstrate that government, labour and business are working together, more than any other time, to find ways of re-igniting growth and building a better life for all. This includes vigorous implementation of the Nine Point Plan, announced by President Jacob Zuma in his 2015 State of the Nation Address as well as Operation Phakisa, designed to fast track implementation of solutions to critical development areas. These programmes address critical issues from the National Development Plan, such as reducing poverty and unemployment.1.5. Cabinet reassures South Africans that the country s unemployment situation is being addressed through the implementation of the country s National Development Plan (NDP) through the Nine Point Plan economic intervention which seeks to ignite growth and boost jobs in key sectors of our economy. The collaboration of the private sector is pivotal for a successful outcome.Government is using all available initiatives including its Industrial Policy Action Plan (IPAP) to create more labour absorbing production and services sectors to address unemployment which has been further impacted by the difficult global and local economic conditions. Minister of Trade and Industry, Rob Davies launched the eighth annual iteration of the IPAP 2016/17 to 2018-19 on 9 May 2016 at a 100% black-owned casting and machining foundry in Gauteng. Government emphasizes the importance of developing close cooperation with cutting-edge local industrial companies involved not just in infrastructure development, transport and logistics, but across a wide range of technologically sophisticated, export ready and labour intensive sectors of the South African economy as a totality.While the Quarterly Labour Force Survey for the first quarter of 2016 recorded an increase in unemployment to 26.7 per cent on a quarter on quarter basis, 2016 employment levels are higher by 204 000 employed people when compared with the first quarter of 2015.1.6. Cabinet welcomes the handover of the Beaufort West Youth Hub, in Western Cape by President Jacob Zuma, which provides a facility to the youth, where they can empower themselves. The Hub has a mix of facilities that provide for holistic development of young people and for the community at large. The facilities available in this youth hub will provide young people from poor communities with opportunities to better participate and contribute positively to their communities and to the country.The fully equipped Skills Centre that is being operated by South Cape College will provide training in business administration, end user computing and early childhood development to 200 National Rural Youth Service Corps (NARYSEC) participants per year. NARYSEC is a long-term programme where only rural youth are targeted, recruited and contracted for a period of two years.Youth between the ages of 18 and 25 years old are recruited and then enrolled for training in various skills that will equip them, both with theoretical and practical knowledge, to create employment for themselves and other people in their communities. This Youth Hub is a Pilot project and the first of its kind, and will be rolled out in other provinces.1.7. Cabinet welcomes the recently held 2016 Open Government Partnership (OGP) Africa Regional Meeting which was hosted by South Africa under the theme ""Open Government for Sustainable Development in Africa"" from 5 to 6 May 2016.This gathering comes seven months after South Africa became the Lead Chairperson of the Open Government Partnership. Open government principles are crucial for achieving a much broader range of sustainable development goals, linking openness to governance for the improvement of the vulnerable and poor around the world.The Open Government Partnership and Open Government is also a key enabler that will assist the global community to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.This Regional Summit was the biggest Open Government Partnership (OGP) Regional summit ever organised by the OGP with very substantive outcomes coming out of each session throughout the conference.In keeping with governments commitment to partnership and good governance, this summit attracted participants from various Civil Society Organisations (CSO) from around the world that are rooted in communities across different sectors outside the traditional CSO s that have always been part of the partnership.1.8 Cabinet notes the approval of the merger of three bottling plants to form the continent's largest bottling plant, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. Cabinet welcomes the agreement on public interest conditions for the merger between government and the Coca-Cola Beverages Africa merger parties that can support our efforts for greater industrialisation in the South African economy.The agreement safeguards aggregate employment levels in the company for a period of three years, protects workers in the bargaining unit from merger-related retrenchments, supports localisation of the supply chain and commits to develop historically disadvantaged farmers and suppliers to the company. Furthermore, R400 million has been committed to fund enterprise development in the agricultural value chain and another R400 million incremental investment to develop downstream distribution and retail capabilities with associated skills development and training. The iconic Appletiser brand will continue to be produced in South Africa.The agreement opens fridge space in coolers owned or supplied by Coca-Cola to smaller retailers: ten percent of fridge space will be available to rival products from smaller producers in retail establishments where only Coca-Cola supplied coolers are available. This opens the market to new entrants and small bottlers, helping to avoid restrictive business practices that keep small and medium-sized businesses out of markets.In addition, the company's long term investment in the country's economic and socialdevelopment will be enhanced through the establishment of the merged entity's headquarters in South Africa. The agreement follows a recent similar agreement entered into with Annhauser Beush InBev relating to the purchase of SAB Miller. In particular, in their emphasis on employment, localisation and small business development, these agreements point to the importance of balancing corporate mergers with public interest issues and set a standard for companies contemplating similar mergers or acquisitions.1.9. Cabinet noted the launch of the Mpact Polymers R350 million bottle-to-bottle plant in partnership with Coca-Cola. This initiative is in response to the Government's legal framework working through the Environmental Affairs' National Waste Management Strategy goal to promote recycling enterprises. The plant is a first of its kind on the African continent diverting 29 000 tonnes (polyethylene terephthalate) PET waste bottles with an estimated saving of 186 000 cubic metres of landfill space and will contribute to reduction of Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of approximately 53 000 tonnes per annum. The Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) provided a R210 million loan facility as well as R30m for its 21% equity stake and the Department of Trade and Industry granted a section 12(I) tax incentive. The recycling plant provides jobs to 80 employees and 1 000 jobs to waste collectors.Partnerships like this are an important engine for economic growth, creating thousands of jobs in the recycling economy that is worth about R50 billion. Currently, plastic recycling alone provides income opportunities for more than 60 000 waste pickers. Mpact Polymers, state of the art recycling plant complies with EU food safety specifications and is the first such factory in Africa which also meets Coca-Cola s full certification protocol for PET bottles.1.10 Cabinet welcomes the report-back on the Integrated Strategic Management of Rhinoceros which has shown that South Africa has turned the tide on rhino poaching. Since the beginning of this year alone 206 alleged poachers have been arrested.The Integrated Strategic Management Approach was adopted by Cabinet in August 2014 which saw the Security Cluster implementing a multi-disciplinary, multi-sectoral intervention to protect rhino in South Africa.1.11 Cabinet congratulates the country for hosting a successful 2016 Tourism Indaba in Durban Kwazulu-Natal, which concluded on Monday, 9 May 2016 with numerous successful interactions between 1 047 exhibitors from 18 African countries and 1 856 buyers from across the globe.  This year, INDABA hosted 3000 more meetings than last year. In total 14 000 business meetings took place over the three days of INDABA, presenting a significant economic benefit potential. The event was also attended by 575 national and international journalists.The INDABA focussed on the industry's small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) showcasing products and services from promising small travel businesses. 70 enterprises gave workshops on how to access the market - and grow. SMMES have the potential to become big business. The INDABA has bolstered the role SMMEs play in the economic development of both developed and developing countries, in growing the tourism sector. Unlocking the potential of SMMEs is one of the critical job drivers in the Nine-Point Plan that will grow and transform the economy and create jobs.2. Key Cabinet decisions2.1. Cabinet discussed the implementation on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission s (TRC) recommendations and proposed options for the implementation of the Community Rehabilitation Projects.Realisation of Community Rehabilitation Projects redress the injustices of the past through the rehabilitation of 128 communities that were subjected to acts of violence and destruction during the conflict period (1 March 1960-10 May 1994).The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development will solicit contributions from relevant stakeholders (public and private) in order to secure adequate resources to bring about holistic interventions in these 128 communities, identified by the TRC on a case by case basis that might differ in value but to a maximum value of R30 million. This will ensure that Projects are feasible and sustainable in order to realise community aspirations.This contributes to the realisation of the National Development Plan through broadening social cohesion and unity, redressing the inequalities of the past and the realisation of a developmental, capable and ethical state that treats citizens with dignity.2.2 Cabinet was briefed on the outcomes of the World Radiocommunications Conference (WRC-15) which was held from 2 to 27 November 2015 in Geneva, Switzerland. South Africa led the Africa Group negotiations that led to the region securing additional spectrum for mobile broadband and Africa managed to protect the lower UHF spectrum for digital terrestrial television. More spectrum allocations were made for maritime, aeronautical and space services.The National Radio Frequency Plan (NRFP) will be updated to reflect the decisions of the WRC-15, which come into force 01 January 2017. The allocation of spectrum within the NRFP will facilitate assignment plans for the different services which are critical to achieving economic, cultural and social benefits through the use of spectrum as a natural resource. In supporting the National Development Plan goals, the spectrum will be used for national broadband rollout, digital terrestrial television, satellite communication and public protection and disaster relief, as well as other services.2.3 Cabinet was briefed on the Decisions taken by the Assembly of the African Union (AU) Heads of State and Government in Johannesburg in June 2015 to revise the assessed annual contributions by Member States from 2016, in order to enhance its ability to carry out its programmes.Cabinet approved implementation of South Africa s new assessed contribution to the AU in line with the Assembly Decision of a new Scale of Assessment. This is based on the principle of solidarity, equitable payment as well as capacity to pay, in a manner that ensures that no single country bears a disproportionate share of the budget.3. Upcoming events3.1. President Jacob Zuma will conduct a State Visit to Doha, Qatar on 19 May 2016 to strengthen political and economic relations between the two countries.3.2. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, as the Special Envoy of President Jacob Zuma to South Sudan, will visit Juba on 16 May 2016. This day is significant to the South Sudanese as they mark the Sudan People's Liberation Army Day.During his visit the Deputy President will monitor implementation of the peace agreement. South Sudan reached a milestone at the end of April 2016 with the swearing in of the transitional government of national unity.3.3. President Jacob Zuma will lead the national and Southern African Development Community (SADC) celebration of the University of Fort Hare Centenary on 20 May 2016. The university s contribution to producing illustrious alumni in the country and Southern Africa bolsters Africa Month celebrations.3.4. Cabinet encourages people to participate in the Africa Month multi-disciplinary programme that involves different generations and genres under the theme  Building a Better Africa and a Better World . All activities emphasise the centrality of local communities and comprise various disciplines including: music, poetry, dance, film, cuisine, fashion, craft and design, intellectual engagements and some collaborative work from South African artists and their counterparts in the continent and the Diaspora.3.5. The International Day for Families will be celebrated on 15 May 2016 under the international theme  Families, healthy lives and Sustainable Future  which relates to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (adopted in 2015). The International Day for Families was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly and focuses on Families: children s and youth s health and well-being; work-family balance and health outcomes; and better quality of life for older persons.3.6. From 16 to 20 May 2016 the Department of Water and Sanitation will lead Sanitation and Hygiene Week under the theme:  It s not about flushing . The campaign will raise awareness on the importance of sanitation and promote sanitation best practices.A key programme is the Bucket Eradication Programme; progress includes total eradication of bucket toilets in formal settlements in KwaZulu-Natal, North West, Mpumalanga and Gauteng. The Western Cape reached 99.8 per cent completion. Progress in other provinces includes the eradication of 20 560 bucket toilets: Free State (4 056), Eastern Cape (2 672); Northern Cape (2 421) and North West (398).Water and Sanitation Minister, Nomvula Mokonyane will participate in the 84th International Committee on Large Dams (ICOLD) at the Sandton Convention Centre from 15 to 20 May 2016. The platform will share knowledge of the design, construction, maintenance and impact of large dams. It will also include tours of large dams in Southern Africa and will contribute to our water conservation efforts.3.7. As part of the Integrated National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, the Department of Basic Education is hosting the 2016 Spelling Bee to improve learners  performance in languages.Cabinet calls on all schools, teachers and parents to encourage primary school learners to enter the 2016 Spelling Bee before entries close on 31 May 2016. For more information visit www.education.gov.za.4. Cabinet s position on key issues in the environment4.1. Cabinet strongly condemns the blatant racism that was displayed by some individuals in our country, particularly on social network platforms. Such behaviour goes against the ethos of our Constitution, enshrined responsibilities and values, and violates the rights of our people. This has no place in our democratic society. In particular Cabinet lamented the racist comments attributed to a senior member of the Judiciary, the High Court Judge Mabel Jansen.The pronouncements especially by an esteemed member of the judiciary are not in keeping with what our society expects from members of the judiciary. The Judiciary should always act impartially and in a manner that is beyond reproach.Tolerance and respect has been a cornerstone of our struggle for freedom and remains an essential part of South Africa s democratic foundation. Let us unite again to jointly defeat the divisiveness of racism in our society.The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development plans to deal with such matters through the introduction of legislation to address racism and in particular hate speech.Cabinet further calls for all South Africans to respect each other as envisaged in our Bill of Rights.4.2. Cabinet reiterates President Jacob Zuma s condemnation of the destruction of 24 schools by people purported to be residents of the Vhembe district in Limpopo. This destruction of educational infrastructure disadvantages our children and undermines the country s effort to provide quality education.Cabinet welcomes the meeting by President Jacob Zuma with King of the Vhavenda, Khosikhulu Thovhele Toni Mphephu Ramabulana which was at the request of his majesty on the 8 May 2016 to resolve issues in Vuwani.President Jacob Zuma has put in place a task team led by the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs to lead the process of developing a package of social infrastructure projects for the Makhado Local Municipality. Cabinet thanks the ministerial Task Team led by Minister Desmond van Rooyen for the inroads made to resolve this matter and appreciates the role played by the Office of Premier Stanley Mathabatha, and the Executive Mayor of Vhembe, Tshitereke Matibe; the Executive Mayor of Thulamela, Grace Mahosi and the Executive Mayor of Makhado, David Mutavhatsindi.During Task Team meetings, the attending traditional leaders made commitments to work with government to resolve the crisis and condemned the destruction of property and violence and called for the urgent resolution of the situation. At these meetings traditional leaders and the Task Team reaffirmed the outcomes of the meeting with the President and resolved to report progress to the President. As we speak the ministerial Task Team is engaging with all stakeholders as a continuing effort by government to normalise the situation in Vuwani and its surrounding villages.Cabinet thanks those members of the community and traditional leadership that have intervened to protect the remaining schools and creating an environment for ongoing dialogue.There can be no valid reason to justify the senseless destruction of critical public infrastructure such as schools. Those residents who are found guilty of burning our public facilities will face the full might of the law.Cabinet reminds South Africans that our democracy affords all citizens a number of platforms to express their concerns and embark on constructive engagement towards an amicable solution. Residents of this district are encouraged to isolate any elements who are leading and destroying the future of our children and report them to the law enforcement agencies.In a separate but related incident Cabinet noted with great concern the continuing violence, disruption of schooling and the burning of the traffic department facilities in the Grabouw area of the Western Cape. Cabinet reiterates that the full might of the law will be applied to those found guilty of criminal activity.4.3. Cabinet conveys its condolences to the family and friends of those who lost their lives due to the flooding in areas of KwaZulu-Natal. Government is providing disaster management services and relief to victims.4.4. Cabinet reminds South Africans to continue using water sparingly to secure sufficient supply for future use, as there are still areas in the country which are experiencing drought conditions.Government support continues to lessen the devastating effects of the drought through short, medium and long term budget allocations to fund interdepartmental programmes that respond to the special needs of drought-affected areas and the need to address water losses in critical supply networks.Government has established an Inter-Ministerial Task Team on Service Delivery, with representation from different sectors. As part of the mitigation measures taken to offset the effects of the drought, dam operating rules have been applied to 35 dams and 4 systems where restrictions are currently applied with regard to the water resource (mandatory restrictions on domestic and agricultural use).To mitigate the effects of the drought on water users, the Department of Water and Sanitation has spent over R500 million on emergency and short-term interventions in KwaZulu-Natal, Free State, North West, Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga, Limpopo, Western Cape and Northern Cape. The medium to long term interventions are intended to ensure that we are more climate change resilient, which reduces the risks for future drought mitigation.The approach employed by government in addressing the drought and land degradation problem, facilitates coherent and integrated intergovernmental responses, namely, the Landcare programme, Working for Water, Working on Fire and Working for Wetlands, that contribute to job creation, food security, skills development, conservation, land rehabilitation and restoration as well as rural development. The advent of the current drought necessitates use of technologies that advance resilience. As such in 2015 South Africa approved the use of drought tolerant genetically modified maize to address the issue of food security. We are also enhancing innovative designs and technologies required in the restoration of affected areas to arrest soil degradation and sustain land productivity.As part of this integrated approach South Africa has committed to partner and become a beneficiary of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) Global target setting support programme. Through these interventions, we join in the global implementation of national voluntary targets as part of achieving the SGDs. The key principle of Land Degradation Neutrality affirms the role of local people in the designing and implementing measures to halt and reverse land degradation. The recently concluded Climate Change Adaptation Strategy identifies priority interventions and harmonises key Water, Agriculture, Biodiversity, Health, Human Settlement, and Disaster Risk Reduction sectoral adaptation plans into a comprehensive National Adaptation Plan. The removal of Alien Species through the Working for Water programme from infested catchment and water courses contributes to improved water quality and quantity4.5. Cabinet noted with concern the strike action at the South African Post Office, the consequences of which have an impact on its repositioning to better service South Africans.Government through the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services is working to address the issues at the Post Office to bring stability and turn the situation around. Last August, the Department appointed a new board, a new CEO and strengthened management to guide the operations and bring stability to SAPO. SAPO s financial stability continues to be top priority.The South African Post Office remains a strategic entity for extending government, e-commerce and financial services to South Africans through it s approximately 2 448 outlets. We are encouraged that management and leaders of organized workers are committed to negotiations as a route to resolve their differences.4.6. Cabinet congratulates the South African team of learners (Liam Baker, Dylan Nelson, SangEun Lee, Ralph McDougall, Timothy Schlesinger, Hannah Clayton, Rauseenah Upadhey, and Mpho Nkwana) for winning the 24th Pan African Mathematics Olympiad in Senegal. Lee, 17, was also crowned African Queen of Mathematics in the competition for girls for the second successive year.Enquiries:Donald LiphokoCell: 082 901 0766"

Implementation of Key Government Programmes1.1. The Fort Hare centenary celebrations which were officiated by President Jacob Zuma were a success. Hundreds of guests, including Alumni and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe as well as diplomats attended this prestigious milestone in South Africa s history.This coincided with Africa Month, which commemorates the founding of the then Organisation of African Unity, now called the African Union (AU). Cabinet welcomes the progress made in resolving students  issues, which should not have caused the destruction to property.1.2. On a working visit by President Jacob Zuma to the Republic of Uganda, both Heads of State agreed to strengthen bilateral relations, and discussed the political and security situation in the Republic of Burundi and eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.President Jacob Zuma also attended the inauguration ceremony of President Yoweri Museveni. South Africa and Uganda have so far 20 signed bilateral agreements, with approximately 70 South African companies currently operating in Uganda. In 2015, South African exports to Uganda amounted to R1.7 billion while South African imports totaled R98 million.1.3. Cabinet welcomes the successful conclusion of President Jacob Zuma s State Visit to the State of Qatar with the signing of several agreements and commitments, such as the Agreements on Defence Cooperation, Police Cooperation, and Cooperation in Arts, Culture and Heritage. The establishment of a Joint Investment Committee to oversee the implementation of agreements in addition to the structured Bilateral Consultations enhances and elevates bilateral relations to a strategic level.The President's interaction with the South Africa-Qatari Business Forum promoted Business-to-Business cooperation aimed at diversifying both economies. With both countries qualifying as maritime countries the potential for cooperation in the Oceans Economy was also discussed. A number of South African companies, mainly in the Petrochemical-related sector operate in Qatar. One of South Africa's largest investments in the Middle East is Sasol, which plays an important role in the development of Qatar s gas reserves.Other issues discussed include trade and economic relations as well as global and regional peace and security matters.1.4. President Jacob Zuma handed over compensation for land as part of Phase 1 of the settlement of claims on the Kruger National Park. A total of R84 million was awarded to six communities, three from Limpopo, and three from Mpumalanga. In terms of land area this portion measured 318 000 hectares.The settlement model took into account the significance of the Kruger National Park and assured viable financial compensation as claimants are not able to return to their land. This is in line with equitable redress under government s land restitution programme and marks an important milestone in the country s transformation programme.In further empowering these communities, a 1 per cent community tourism fund has been generating approximately R6.5 million per annum for community beneficiation. This has resulted in the building of a number of education facilities including an administration block at Dumisani High School, a computer laboratory at Masiza High School, science laboratories at Tlakulani and Sibusisiswe high schools, a kitchen facility and playground for Grade R learners at Takheleni Primary School. In 2016/17 in consultation with the affected communities, the building of four science laboratories in Mbuyane High School; Mahlale Secondary School; Lepato High School and Makuya Secondary School, covering both Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces have been prioritised.Cabinet emphasised the importance of the partnership between multi ethnic communities which contributes to social cohesion. South Africa s land restitution model is evolving based on prior experiences and is now underpinned by creating sustainable economic benefit rather than the troubled once-off financial transfers which often left communities no better off. Phase 2 of the settlement claim will consist of projects aimed at ensuring the communities continue to benefit in the longer term from business opportunities within the Park.1.5. The outcomes from the Summit on the Integration of Compensation Systems under the theme  Access to equitable, fair and sustainable compensation system for all workers  led by the Ministers of Health and Labour, Aaron Motsoaledi and Mildred Oliphant, and supported by the Deputy Ministers of Mineral Resources, Health, Labour and  Mineral Resources were recieved.The summit focused on occupational health and safety with a view to develop an integrated compensation system for South Africa. Ministers from the Southern African Development Countries (SADC) region; South African Mining Industry and organised labour as well as the ex-mineworkers associations also participated at the Summit.Through the envisaged integrated compensation system, government will ensure that workers and ex-workers in mines and works receive market related compensation benefits which provides for their sustainable welfare and that of their families. Working together with the workers representatives and mining sector, government aims to implement a monitoring and evaluation system that will provide incentives to companies with good safety and compensation legislation compliance.1.6. Cabinet welcomed the opening of the country s first Bio-Manufacturing Industry Development Centre (BIDC) in Pretoria by the Department of Science and Technology.The centre s work is part of the country s Nine Point Plan to unlock the potential of small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs).  It supports SMMEs involved in bio-manufacturing by enabling them to exploit market opportunities. Companies incubated at the BIDC have access to ready-to-use bio-manufacturing facilities, support in research and development laboratories.The initial phase will result in the creation of permanent and temporary jobs with the economic impact projected at R250 million per annum in the next five years. Currently the BIDC is supporting 19 enterprises of which 16 are owned by black entrepreneurs, including 10 black women-owned enterprises. In addition, 55 permanent and 171 temporary jobs have already been created, with 54 interns trained.1.7. The announcement by the Minister of Energy, Tina Joemat-Pettersson to develop a Gas Policy guides the country towards a sustainable natural gas economy. The introduction of gas as an additional source of power in South Africa s energy mix will lessen the dependence of coal and ensure sufficient, diverse and secure energy availability to citizens and the economy, now and into the future. This will also increase the country s trajectory of realising a re-industrialised economy, a higher and inclusive growth path and job creation.In the interim the Department of Energy is undertaking a gas-to-power programme, which will deliver 3,726MW of electricity and also serve as a catalyst for the development of a local gas industry which will encourage upstream exploration in an investor friendly enabling environment. Employment opportunities associated directly and indirectly with this industry development will amount to 1, 25 million full time equivalent job opportunities over a 25 year period. In the shorter term the gas-to-power programme will contribute to buffer economic output decreases and help prevent job losses.1.8. The official rollout of the national  Save Energy  campaign during the 2016 African Utility Week Conference, led by the Department of Energy, builds on the government Energy Savings campaign launched by President Jacob Zuma in 2015.  1.9. Also launching is an  Appliance Check  campaign, an energy efficiency measure that will give consumers a choice when purchasing appliances. A label will be fixed to all appliances to indicate how they perform in relation to the Minimum Energy Performance Standard.1.10. Cabinet noted the Africa Energy Inward Buying Mission hosted by the Department of Trade and Industry and the South African Electrotechnical Export Council. South African companies with manufacturing and engineering service competencies were exposed to representatives of power utilities from Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, South Sudan and Nigeria. This better positioned South African companies to participate in the investment opportunities of the power infrastructure roll-out for Africa estimated at between $20 billion and $42 billion a year over the next 10 years.1.11. Cabinet is encouraged by the launch of the Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) long-term solution at the AMD Central Basin in Germiston which will be two thirds funded by the mining sector and one third by water users. This follows the successful completion of the short-term solution under the Inter-Ministerial Committee on AMD. In 2011 government mandated the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority, a State-owned entity under the Department of Water and Sanitation, to provide a short-term solution to the AMD challenge in Gauteng.The purpose of the long-term solution is to further treat the contaminated water by removing sulphates and creating water for commercial use as either industrial or potable water.1.12. Cabinet appeals to all Lesotho nationals who are residing in South Africa illegally to apply for a Lesotho Special Permit at a Visa Facilitation Service Centre before 30 June 2016. The Lesotho Special Permit is issued under a special dispensation for Lesotho nationals who are working, studying or running businesses in South Africa and have been in the country in such capacity before 30 September 2015. Furthermore, Lesotho applicants who fraudulently obtained South African documents are advised to surrender them to the designated Home Affairs offices so as to obtain an amnesty letter. This amnesty will expire on 31 December 2016. Employers of Lesotho nationals should also take advantage of this permit.1.13. Cabinet welcomes the announcement by Sport and Recreation Minister Fikile Mbalula that local boxing is being broadcast again on SABC. To date  Boxing is Back  and  TKO  programmes on SABC have reached over 1.3 million households. The return of this sport to television, will greatly benefit the revenue of Boxing South Africa, strengthen women boxing and support upcoming promoters and boxers.2. Key Cabinet decisions2.1 Cabinet was briefed on the conclusion of negotiations and legal scrubbing of the Economic Partnership Agreement between the Southern African Development Community Group and the European Union (EU). Cabinet approved that the Economic Partnership Agreement be submitted to Parliament.The Agreement will establish a single trade regime between the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and the EU. It will also enhance South Africa s preferential access to the European Union market for a range of agricultural products such as sugar, ethanol, wine, fisheries and fruit. The EPA builds on the Trade and Development Cooperation Agreement (TDCA) that South Africa concluded in 2000 with the EU.The Economic Partnership Agreement provides South Africa with additional policy space in several areas. South Africa also negotiated a bilateral Protocol on Geographical Indicators with the EU, due to growing interest in protecting wine names and specialised agricultural product names. As such, 102 wine names will be protected under the Agreement and three agricultural product names namely Rooibos, Honeybush, Karoo Lamb.The Agreement ensures in line with the National Development Plans objectives that South Africa advances industrialisation and promotes South African exports into the EU market. Most importantly, the EPA promotes the development of regional value chains in Africa thus contributing to regional integration.2.2 Cabinet approved the publication of the Green Paper on International Migration in the Government Gazette for public comment. Cabinet was also briefed on further stakeholder consultations and engagements on the Green Paper for 2016/17.The Green Paper is aligned to the National Development Plan and takes the position that to end poverty and create decent work, migration must be used to break these patterns, by growing our skills and knowledge base and by removing barriers to regional development. This requires South Africa to invest strategically in the further development of an efficient and secure immigration system. Implementation of International Migration will take us closer to achieving a balance between meeting South Africa s development needs while safeguarding South Africa s integrity and national security.2.3 Cabinet also approved for the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to co-host the World Aquaculture Society Conference, together with the Aquaculture Association of Southern Africa, from 26 to 30 June 2017 in South Africa. This will be the first time that the World Aquaculture Conference is held in Africa.The aquaculture sector has been prioritised by government to play a pivotal role in food security and economic growth of the country. Aquaculture has been included in the key initiative of Operation Phakisa: Oceans Economy. Hosting of this Conference will enable South Africa to fast-track development of and investment in the aquaculture sector through the information and knowledge sharing as well as the networking opportunities.Hosting will also create an opportunity for the tourism sector to showcase the country s tourism activities and the local farmers will also showcase their technology innovations at the tradeshow that will cater for more than 100 exhibitors from leading aquaculture nations worldwide.African countries will also have an opportunity to participate and showcase their products which will have a positive impact on economic development for the aquaculture sector in the African region and South Africa.2.4 Cabinet was briefed on the refinements made to the Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) Chapter on Outcome 12 and the 2016/17 Programme of Action. This responds to the Cabinet decision to strengthen alignment between the MTSF Chapter on Outcome 12   An efficient, effective and development orientated Public Service, for the period 2014-2019 and the National Development Plan.3. Upcoming events3.1 June will see the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the June 16 1976 uprising, which profoundly changed the socio-political landscape in South Africa. The commemoration is being be overseen by an Inter-Ministerial Committee.Youth Month will be launched on 1 June 2016 under the theme  Youth Taking South Africa Forward  at Hector Petersen Memorial, Soweto by Minister in the Presidency, Jeff Radebe. This will see a month long programme, coordinated by the National Youth Development Agency, dedicated to enabling and encouraging our youth to more easily take up opportunities across various sectors so as to better their lives and enable them to effectively contribute to the development of the economy and the country.This builds up to the National Youth Day proceedings on 16 June 2016, which will be officiated by President Jacob Zuma at Orlando Stadium in Soweto.3.2 The Department of Social Development will launch National Child Protection Week in Braakspruit Farm, Klerksdorp on 29 May 2016 under the theme:  Let Us All Protect Children to Move South Africa Forward .  The week will coincide with an International Children s Day event on 1 June 2016 which will be led by President Jacob Zuma at an orphanage and youth centre in Atteridgeville, Gauteng and conclude on 5 June 2016 in Amersfoort, Mpumalanga.Cabinet urges communities to protect children against neglect, abuse, violence and exploitation by reporting all such incidences to the authorities.3.3 The Department of Environment Affairs will lead the country in marking World Environment Day on 5 June 2016 to mobilise South Africans to take positive environmental action to protect our planet. This year s World Environment Day theme: ""Go Wild for Life,"" focusses on wildlife crime and the damage it causes.South Africa s success in conservation of our biodiversity has made the country a prime target for organised, transnational environmental and wildlife crime. The impact of environmental and wildlife crime is devastating on ecosystems, sustainable livelihoods and tourism.3.4 The observance of World Oceans Day on 8 June 2016 under the  Healthy Oceans, Healthy Planet  allows us to highlight the impact of oceans on our country and the various ways in which oceans contribute to our economy. It also highlights challenges in dealing with marine pollution, maintaining the oceans  capacity to regulate the global climate, supplying essential ecosystem services and providing sustainable livelihoods and safe recreation.4. Cabinet s position on key issues in the environment4.1 Government remains focused on reigniting economic growth, preserving existing jobs and creating more sustainable jobs through working together with business and labour. Through our programme of structural reforms and fiscal consolidation, government will remain within its expenditure ceiling to ensure that our economy emerges stronger when the global economy recovers. President Jacob Zuma has led several effective interventions through partnerships, both domestically and internationally to boost economic growth and job creation.4.2 Cabinet noted the growing number of investment initiatives that have been announced in the country which demonstrate confidence by the international investment community in South Africa s economy. It further demonstrates that our country is on a path to recovery and continues to be a viable investment destination. The magnitude of the following investments demonstrates the continued confidence that global automotive producers have in South Africa as an investment destination, and the supportive policy environment that government is providing.  4.3. These include the investment by Toyota for a new Toyota Hilux and Fortuner manufacturing plant in Prospecton, Durban, which was opened by President Jacob Zuma. This was made possible through the support provided by the Department of Trade and Industry which has attracted investments of over R25 billion in the automotive industry in the past five years. This investment will support more than 4 000 jobs with total employment in the plant already exceeding 8 000 jobs.This plant is part of Toyota's injection of R6.1 billion investment into South Africa's manufacturing industry and the country's local vehicle production. Toyota has increased local procurement in its supply chain to support local component suppliers, the company has also focused on recruiting female technicians and providing more opportunities to women in the workforce.4.4 Cabinet also welcomed the BMW announcement on the start of its R6 billion construction of a new, state-of-the-art body shop. The expansion will enable BMW to produce and export the next generation of the BMW X3. This demonstrates the Rosslyn Plant as being highly competitive within the global BMW production network both in terms of cost of production and quality.4.5 In another investment, the Minister of Trade and Industry launched a R100 million Dursots & All Joy Tomato Processing Plant in Modjadjiskloof near Tzaneen. The factory currently employs 70 people with a potential increase of 300 by next year. It would also create a further 900 seasonal jobs. The company has also initiated an export structure and plans on exporting 25% of its products to the Middle East, China and the rest of Africa.These investments showcase the steady implementation of the Nine-Point Plan and the Industrial Policy Action Plan (IPAP) that focus on increasing manufacturing-based value addition, employment creation and export-intensity to grow the economy and create jobs. Despite global economic headwinds, the South African economy is poised to forge ahead.4.6 Cabinet reminds all eligible voters to responsibly exercise their democratic right on 3 August 2016. Cabinet expresses its gratitude to all those voters who took the time to register and verify their details, to ensure that their name appears on the voters  role, which is now closed.Minister van Rooyen has gazetted and proclaimed the date of the local government elections, allowing for the commencement of the electoral processes in terms of the election timetable. The announcement also closes the voter s roll for registration to participate in the upcoming elections.Cabinet welcomes the signing of the Electoral Code of Conduct by political parties pledging to abide by the rules and ensure that elections are free and fair. This demonstrates our maturing and deepening democracy.4.7 Cabinet welcomes the 2016 Special National Members Assembly held by the South African Local Government Association (SALGA). This comes as the country gears itself for a transition into the next term of local government ahead of the 2016 municipal elections.The Assembly reflected on the progress made over the last 16 years and during this term of local government. The role of local government in the delivery of services and the restoration of human dignity was also profiled. Key challenges were also addressed and a recommitment made to the COGTA Back to Basics programme.This paves the way for the fourth democratic local government term by providing a support programme for municipalities and managing the transition to ensure stability and uninterrupted service provision to the people of South Africa.4.8 Cabinet expressed concern at the disruptions in Parliament, which are increasing in frequency and intensity. Parliament is an institution of our hard fought democracy and a public platform which must be respected by all.4.9 Cabinet commends the work of the Inter-Ministerial Committee led by Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Des van Rooyen and the provincial task team to restore normality to Vuwani, while noting that challenges continue in some parts.Government has worked tirelessly engaging communities in a bid to resolve issues and bring services, including education back into operation. The provision of temporary classrooms has ensured the resumption of academic activities.Government again calls on communities and leaders to raise issues through channels and platforms which have been established to enable dialogue. This unprecedented action of holding the education of our children hostage is unacceptable.Cabinet commends all law enforcement agencies for the work done which resulted in the arrest of 34 individuals, who are suspected of participating in the destruction of 28 schools, who in effect shattered the future of those young people who are still utilising these much needed facilities.Cabinet commends those communities and civil society organisations who rolled up their sleeves to clean up and raise funds to reopen local schools. All parents, guardians and community members are requested to assist children to catch up with the scheduled work plan of the Department of Basic Education. The IMC will continue to engage with stakeholders and communities to ensure that the entire area is calm and returns to normality.4.10 Cabinet deliberated on the protests in Hammanskraal and indicated that the Department of Human Settlements is leading an intervention in the area together with the Gauteng Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and Human Settlements, and the Executive Mayor of Tshwane, Cllr Kgosientso Ramokgopa. Cabinet regrets the death of two contractors involved in the Hammanskraal removals and expresses its sympathy with the families of the bereaved. Law enforcement agencies should redouble their efforts to find the killers and bring them to justice.4.11 Cabinet congratulates the South African Broadcasting Corporation s decision to play 90 per cent local music across all its radio stations so as to promote our home-grown content.The decision reflects government s broadcasting policy which encourages the safeguarding, enrichment and strengthening of the cultural and social fabric of South Africa. This exposure is also motivating to all the upcoming South African talent.Cabinet encourages all citizens to support our local music industry which will make a significant contribution to the economy and preserve the country s diverse cultures.4.12 Cabinet noted the investigation of nine foreign fishing vessels by Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries and commends the combined operation involving the South African Navy, the Department of Fisheries and the South African Maritime Safety Authority which resulted in four of the vessels being arrested.The capturing of these vessels indicates our seriousness as a country to protect our territorial and exclusive economic zone. Our marine resources are a source of food security and play a huge role in realising our goals in Operation Phakisa and must be protected.4.13 Cabinet welcomed the release of the report of the ministerial task team appointed by Minister Angie Motshekga to investigate allegations into the selling of posts of educators by members of teachers unions and departmental officials in provincial education departments.4.14 Cabinet congratulated the South African recipients, entrepreneur Luvuyo Rani and The Clothing Bank, who were among the winners of 2016 Social Entrepreneurs awards by the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship which was presented at the fringes of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Africa, Kigali Rwanda.4.15 Cabinet salutes and extends its good wishes to the former Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke who retired from the Bench after joining the Constitutional Court in 2002. The former Deputy Chief Justice is a highly regarded jurist and a respected veteran of the country s liberation struggle. In his younger years, Moseneke was involved in the liberation struggle as a member of the Pan Africanist Congress. He was tried and convicted for his political activities and, at the age of 15, became the youngest prisoner to be incarcerated on Robben Island. He was also part of the technical committee that drafted the interim Constitution in 1993 and was later appointed deputy chairperson of the Independent Electoral Commission ahead of South Africa s first democratic elections.Cabinet also pays tribute to Supreme Court of Appeal president Judge Lex Mpati who retires from the Bench in May after 27 years of illustrious service to South Africa. Judge Mpati personifies the values of rising above self; of modesty, commitment and excellence; and of ethical behaviour.Cabinet congratulates and extends its best wishes to Justice Baaitse  Bess  Nkabinde as acting Deputy Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court until the position is filled.5. AppointmentsAll appointments are subject to the verification of qualifications and the relevant clearance.5.1 Office of the Public Service Commission:a) Dr DC Mamphiswana as the, Director General, at the Office of the Public Service CommissionEnquiries:Liezel CerfCell: 076 778 2380"
Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 8 June 2016,9 Jun 2016,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-8-june-2016-9-jun-2016-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-8-june-2016-9-jun-2016-0000,"1.1. We have noted the reviews by international rating agencies Fitch, Standard & Poor s and Moody s, which reaffirmed South Africa s investment grade credit rating and maintained its stable outlook. The rating reviews affirm the continuing work by government to turn the economy around and give the country the necessary space to continue implementing its intervention plans.1.2. The dedicated work of Team South Africa constituted by government, business and labour is ensuring that South Africa avoids a junk status rating. South Africa is implementing programmes from the National Development Plan (NDP) which will ensure that the country remains an investment destination. This demonstrates that working together we can reignite our economy, attract investment and create much-needed jobs for South Africans.1.3. Even though South Africa s real gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 1.2% in the first quarter of 2016, according to figures released by Statistics South Africa (Stats SA), government is already implementing key interventions in those sectors most impacted on such as agriculture, transport, electricity and mining, which are being addressed through Operation Phakisa, to unblock the constraints to growth.1.4. The centralisation of estimates for GDP is now located in Stats SA. Historically, the responsibilities for the compilation and dissemination of South Africa s system of national accounts were that Stats SA was responsible for the annual and quarterly production-based estimates of GDP while the South African Reserve Bank published the quarterly expenditure-based estimates of GDP.1.5. As government we address the needs of citizens and working together we are changing the lives of South Africans. The R116-million water treatment plant in Steytlerville, outside Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape, will combat water shortages. This was launched by the Department of Trade and Industry (the dti), through its Critical Infrastructure Programme, the Department of Water and Sanitation, and the Baviaans Local Municipality.In a water-scarce country, this new water treatment plant will create the capacity for the community and businesses to access about 24 litres per second from eight to 10 litres, which is sufficient to meet the water demand of Steytlerville for the next 15 years.The new plant also forms part of the overall economic development of the town as it brings stability for farmers, small-scale businesses and investors. The funding from the dti to the Baviaans Local Municipality for the infrastructure resulted in the project creating an estimated 238 construction jobs in the area. The project is key to boosting economic growth and creating much-needed jobs.1.6. As part of government s rail revitalisation programme, Cabinet welcomed the testing of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa s new X Trapolis Mega commuter trains. The new state-of-the-art trains scheduled for operation in October this year have automatic doors, open passageways throughout the train, air conditioning and closed-circuit television for enhanced commuter safety.These trains connect South Africans and play a key role in supporting public transport and igniting growth.1.7. In better enabling small businesses National Treasury and the Black Business Council established a centre which will assist small businesses with registration on the Central Supplier Database (CSD), e-tender queries and other client services of National Treasury. This goes a long way in reducing red tape and making it easier for businesses, especially small businesses, to take advantage of economic opportunities and contribute to the development of our economy and country.1.8. We encourage prospective and current service providers to register on the CSD, which is the source of all supplier information for all spheres of government. The purpose of centralising government s supplier database is to reduce duplication of effort and cost for both supplier and government while enabling electronic procurement processes.1.9. A further contribution to the creation of decent employment through inclusive economic growth was the recently held National Jobs Fair under the theme:  Jobs Summit and Jobs Fair   my job my future  empowers the unemployed with soft skills, information and face-to-face search for placement opportunities, especially around further learning, self-employment, cooperatives and community works programmes.1.10. Parliament s passing of the Expropriation Bill provides legal certainty to the State to continue with the implementation of our country s programme of radical socio-economic transformation to resolve the land question firmly at the centre of its agenda. It defines the  administratively just process  that any expropriating authority must follow.This Expropriation Bill and envisaged Act provide for procedural efficiency, certainty and more quicker expropriations in the public interest, including land restitution. A person or community dispossessed of property over centuries are entitled to the extent provided by this Bill to restitution of that property or to equitable redress.It also sets out the rules by which the government can lay claim to land  in the public interest  and  for public purposes . The Bill follows the Bill of Rights and Property Clause criteria to be considered in the case of compensation for expropriation. It will also allow for property owners to be fairly and equitably compensated.Once signed into law, the Bill repeals the Expropriation Act, 1975 (Act 63 of 1975).1.11. Inclusive growth is the focus of the Presidential Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) Advisory Council which met recently. The B-BBEE Advisory Council will be working closely with the Presidential Professional Working Group, established by President Jacob Zuma, to ensure that issues affecting black professionals are attended to.The meeting is another demonstration of the spirit of unity and partnership to reignite inclusive economic growth, bearing in mind the goal of BEE so that we can move forward in transforming and deracialising the economy.1.12. South Africa is for the first time participating in a two-day VIII International Information Technology (IT) Forum in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia, represented by Minister Faith Muthambi. The forum is taking place from 8 to 9 June 2016, and leverages science and technology to solve some of the biggest challenges in our education and health systems. Delegates at the forum include representatives of business, professional associations, research, educational and IT experts from BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) member states.1.13. The 5th Annual Waste Management Khoro, led by the Minister of Environmental Affairs under the theme  Promoting Innovation and Upscaling Enterprise Development  aims to improve service delivery, ensure the fast turnaround of waste-management programmes to promote the recycling economy, while bringing more of our communities into the mainstream economy, by accelerating access to job opportunities in the waste sector.1.14. The release of the local government audit outcomes for 2014/15 shows an improvement of audit results by municipalities from 2010/11 to 2014/15.The number of municipalities that received financially unqualified audit opinions with no findings increased from 13 to 54. Furthermore, 18 additional municipal entities also achieved a clean audit status, taking the total number of clean audits to 72 in the current period. There was a significant reduction in adverse and disclaimed opinions, which decreased from over 30% in 2010/11 to about 11% of municipalities in the current period.This improvement in the audit outcomes of municipalities has been the result of the Back to Basics Programme, Operation Clean Audit, decisive leadership, improved financial and performance management and record keeping.1.15. Cabinet noted the judgement by the Supreme Court of Appeal declaring the Digital Broadcasting Migration Policy in 2015 unlawful, invalid and setting it aside. The Presidency, departments of Communications, Telecommunications and Postal Services, and Justice and Constitutional Development will advise government on the full implications of the judgement.1.16. With Local Government Elections scheduled to be held on Wednesday, 3 August 2016, all political parties have to abide by the electoral code of conduct, which all parties have signed. This binds all parties contesting in the elections to play their part in securing a free and fair election. Political parties and supporters must abide by the Constitution and those guilty of criminal activity will face the full might of law.In light of the recent political intolerance, the Minister of Police has established a multi-disciplinary task team that comprises South African Police Service (SAPS) Crime Intelligence, Detective Services, Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) and Forensics to underpin the vision of Medium Term Strategic Framework Outcome Three, which states that  All people in South Africa are and feel safe .1.17. On the matter of the terror alert issued by the United States (US) Embassy in Pretoria. Cabinet reiterates the statement issued by The Presidency that the Security Cluster met yesterday to discuss the matter further, with a view to ensuring the continued safety of all in the country.In addition, the South African Government will continue to discuss the matter with the US Government as part of ongoing cooperation on security issues between the two countries. South Africa and the US continue to enjoy strong and cordial relations in various areas of cooperation including political, economic, social and security matters.1.18. This year marks the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the 16 June 1976 uprising, which profoundly changed the socio-political landscape in South Africa. President Zuma will officiate at the National Youth Day proceedings at Orlando Stadium in Soweto on 16 June 2016 under the theme:  Youth Taking South Africa Forward .Highlights will include the Keynote Address by the President and the wreath-laying ceremony at the Hector Pieterson Memorial.A special media conference will be held on Tuesday, 14 June 2016 to provide further details, on the programme for Youth Day. Ministers and Deputy Ministers have been engaging with our people, especially youth through this month to encourage them to take up opportunities across various sectors so as to better their lives and enable them to effectively contribute to the development of the economy and the country.The programmes of Ministers involved in the Youth Month Programme will be published on government websites and social media platforms.1.19. With the onset of the initiation period, many young males are preparing to enter the rite of passage to adulthood.Government, led by the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA), is working with the Institutions of Traditional Leadership and all stakeholders to ensure that the 2016 initiation season pursues  Zero Deaths  which is driven through a theme    We Love Our Tradition, We Value Life of Our Youth .Families, parents and legal guardians must ensure that the young men only choose legally operating initiation schools, where pre-screening is done, and surgeons are well trained and well known by parents. Communities are requested to report any illegal activities on 0800 111 166 or #zero tolerance on initiation deaths.2. Key Cabinet decisions2.1. The President of the Republic of South Africa, President Jacob Zuma, was selected to the Heads of State High Level Panel on Water; and the Director-General of the Department of Water and Sanitation was appointed as Sherpa (a civil servant or diplomat who undertakes preparatory work prior to a summit conference) to the President of South Africa as a Panel Member to the High Level Panel on Water.The United Nation s Secretary-General s (UNSG) Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation recommended the establishment of a select Heads of State High Level Panel on Water to lead the advocacy initiative on water and adaptation, following the adoption of the 2030 Development Agenda by the UNSG in September 2015.The panel will accelerate the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goal 6 (clean water and sanitation), which has renewed focus on the profound impact of climate change on the water cycle. It is in this light and given the persistent drought that is experienced across the country, that Team South Africa is encouraged to participate in the cleaning up of rivers, streams and wetlands on 18 July, as part of South Africa s annual Mandela Day activities.2.2. The Communication Strategy on the NDP Vision 2030 highlights the implementation of the NDP and will communicate the impact of the NDP on South Africans. A special media briefing will be held to unpack the communication strategy, use of the logo, branding guidelines and applications to ensure a uniformed communication approach across all government departments and implementing agencies. 2.3. The Report on the Extent of Desertification in South Africa and its impact on the rural economy and related strategies being implemented to address these challenges.The effects of Desertification, Land Degradation and Drought impede efforts aimed at poverty eradication, safeguarding food security, enhancing water quality and quantity, resilience and adaptation to climate change as well as achieving sustainable development.In this regard, South Africa has introduced a number of legislative tools, policies, strategies and practical programmes aimed at addressing desertification and land degradation at all levels. These interventions contribute to conservation and socio-economic upliftment while creating job opportunities, skills development and enhancing livelihoods.2.4. The release of this report contributes to recognition of June 17 as the World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought, which was proclaimed by the UN General Assembly. This year s World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought advocates for the importance of inclusive cooperation to restore and rehabilitate degraded land and contribute towards achieving the overall Sustainable Development Goals. In doing so, South Africa fulfils its obligations under the UN Convention to Combat Desertification.2.5. The response report to issues received from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, was approved. This relates to the second report on implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.These will be considered at the 73rd Session to be held in Geneva from 13 to 30 September 2016. Cabinet also noted the commencement of the data collection process for the next treaty periodic reports on the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child to be submitted by 7 January 2017 and 15 July 2017, respectively.2.6. The recommendations and proposals from the Comprehensive Report on the Review of the implementation of the White Paper for Social Welfare of 1997 were approved. This will fast track the revised White Paper for Social Welfare, which is aligned to the government priority of building cohesive, caring, sustainable and safe communities.The recommendations focus on the priorities in the NDP, which identify social protection and developmental social welfare as pathways to progressively achieve social development. Implementation of these will have a positive impact on the lives of people who are at risk, who are vulnerable and who are living in extreme poverty, particularly women, children and people with disabilities. It will ensure that such groups have access to a specified core basket of social development services required to improve their standard of living and enhance their social welfare.2.7. South Africa will enter into an Amended Treaty on Extradition with the Republic of Botswana, in terms of article 231(1) of the Constitution.The aim is for more effective cooperation between South Africa and Botswana so as to facilitate the extradition requests received from Botswana where the death penalty is a possible sentence.This underscores that South Africa will not be a safe haven for criminals by providing for the extradition of fugitives and to facilitate the effectiveness of law-enforcement authorities in the prevention, investigation and prosecution of crime.2.8. The SAPS will in the near future be publishing one annual comprehensive report and crime statistics on a quarterly basis. The annual comprehensive report will accommodate the changes in crime statistics that may result from quality assurance and changes related to the status of the cases that may take place during the year under consideration.The need for frequent statistics will better enable government decision-making to address issues from crime trends. This contributes to the NDP pillar, which states that people in South Africa need to contribute to building safer communities.3. Bills3.1. The Copyright Amendment Bill and the Performers  Protection Amendment Bill will be introduced into Parliament. The Copyright Act, 1978 (Act 98 of 1978) and the Performers Protection Act, 1967 (Act 11 of 1967) are outdated and do not consider developments at multilateral level nor deal with digital issues.This is aligned to the NDP s objectives of promoting innovation, improved productivity, more intensive pursuit of a knowledge economy and better exploitation of comparative and competitive advantage.The current policy revision is based on the need to align the Intellectual Property legislation with the digital era and developments at a multilateral level. This also secures a one-policy approach at national and international level from government. This revision also includes the incorporation of key flexibilities in the area of copyright and performers  protection.4. Upcoming events4.1. The Inter-Ministerial Committee is at an advanced stage of preparations for hosting the 21st International AIDS Conference, which will be held at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre in Durban from 18 to 22 July 2016, co-hosted by government and the International AIDS Society.South Africa is ready to host the conference, which will also boost the tourism industry, small, medium and micro enterprises, and the informal trading sector.The conference provides a momentous opportunity for the country to showcase its massive successes in addressing HIV and AIDS issues. It has global significance as it attracts between 18 000 to 20 000 participants from 180 countries. Global leaders from government, political leaders, captains of industry, civil society, development partners and academic institutions participate.The next meeting of the IMC will be held in Durban and includes an inspection of the facilities. A special media briefing will be held on Monday, 13 June 2016.4.2.

Implementation of key government programmes1.1. Cabinet deliberated on the fourth quarter progress reports of the implementation of the government Programme of Action (PoA) and the outcomes. Government is making progress by addressing challenges and intervening to close the gaps in the implementation of the PoA.Government is confident that it is making headway in the execution of the Medium Term Strategic Framework, Nine-Point Plan and ultimately achieve Vision 2030 of the National Development Plan (NDP).Government Communications (GCIS) is in the process of coordinating the PoA report-back media briefings to keep the nation informed.1.2. Cabinet welcomes the outcomes from the Presidential Labour Working Group, which met on 21 June 2016 to discuss the economy and other socio-economic issues.The meeting agreed to reaffirm its commitment to work together to overcome challenges facing South Africa as we have done so previously. We need to build on the partnerships and solidarity forged in 2008 when social partners crafted a pact that protected workers from the global economic crisis. The meeting resolved that priority must be to protect jobs, create more decent jobs   especially for young people   and improve working conditions of all workers in order to create a better life for all.The planned Jobs Summit by government and labour will allow South Africans to discuss how we can create jobs and grow our economy in the tough current economic climate.1.3. Cabinet expresses its sincere gratitude and thanks to all South Africans who paid tribute and took time to honour the 40th Anniversary of the Soweto uprisings, which represents the heroic struggles of young people of 1976. The National Youth Day was commemorated under the theme  Youth Moving South Africa Forward .The national commemoration, which was led by President Jacob Zuma at Orlando Stadium on 16 June, was one of the events which were held across the country to honour the legacy of the 1976 generation. Government reassures the young people of our country that the struggle for access to education for all remains a government priority. Government will not rest until it has achieved this objective as reflected in the Freedom Charter and enshrined in the Bill of Rights in our Constitution, which this year marks 20 years of its adoption.The continuing month-long programme has various initiatives by government, business and civil society elevating issues of youth through various activities.1.4. South Africa successfully hosted the 60th Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) Annual Global Summit, which was addressed by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa. This reinforces the continent s emergence as a consumer market which presents new opportunities.In South Africa, the consumer goods industry remains a major driver of economic growth. The country s business environment is stable, vibrant and conducive to increased trade and investment. Local and foreign investments are protected by relevant legal prescripts.Various South African companies and international conglomerates that are members of the CGF are trading and investing in South Africa, contributing to the growth of our economy and job creation.1.5. The new trade deal that was signed by Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies with the European Union (EU) was welcomed. This will see more South African agricultural products being exported to Europe. South Africa together with Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and Swaziland signed the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) that was negotiated with the EU.The EPA provides improved market access opportunities for South African products, including a significant improvement in quota for wine and new market access for sugar and ethanol. Under the new agreement, South Africa s duty-free wine exports to the EU are expected to double. The Rules of Origin on clothing have also been simplified and will encourage South African clothing exports to the EU.The EPA replaces the trade chapter in the Trade Development and Cooperation Agreement, signed in 2000, between the EU and South Africa. The agreement also provides for the protection of South African geographic indications which include mainly South African wine names, Rooibos, Honeybush and Karoo lamb.1.6. The investment of a R500-million innovation centre in Johannesburg by the United States multinational, General Electric (GE), was welcomed and is a demonstration that South Africa and the continent are viable investment destinations. This is the group s 10th such centre globally and its first in Africa. The building is also the new headquarters for GE Healthcare, which showcases various healthcare technologies. This demonstrates GE s long-term commitment to both the continent and to finding innovative solutions to Africa s infrastructure and healthcare problems.The centre aims to enhance the career aspirations of over 100 engineers from previously disadvantaged backgrounds. Space has also been allocated for collaborative projects and solution prototyping with Transnet partnering with GE on various rail localisation projects. The centre also aspires to support the development of small businesses capable of supplying the local market and potentially GE s global supply chains. Cabinet calls on all other multinationals to emulate the example set by GE.1.7. Cabinet welcomes the completion of the first phase of the revitalised Botshabelo Industrial Park in the Free State, which was launched by Minister Davies. The first phase of the revitalisation includes the security infrastructure upgrade, fencing, street lighting and critical electricity requirements at a cost of R24 million. This is part of the R189 million invested in covering six prioritised parks linked to the Industrial Policy Action Plan (IPAP). The Botshabelo Industrial Park will create employment for the people of Botshabelo and surrounding areas, promote industrialisation and the growth of small businesses and cooperatives, attract investments and encourage manufacturing.1.8. In responding to the water needs of the Moqhaka Local Municipality, Cabinet welcomes the launch of the Kroonstad Waste Water Treatment Works by the Minister of Water and Sanitation, Ms Nomvula Mokonyane.The area has been plagued by the recent drought and has seen water levels reaching critical status. Water tankers have been handed over and short and medium-term efforts include drilling and refurbishing boreholes in Kroonstad to augment the supply of water.1.9. President Zuma attended the 6th Ordinary Summit of International Conference of the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) themed:  Accelerating the effective implementation of the Pact and its Protocols for a more democratic and stable Great Lakes Region . The summit discussed, amongst other issues, the political and security situation in the Great Lakes Region including South Sudan, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic, and a full report of the ICGLR Summit will be presented at the next African Union (AU) Summit. President Zuma said there was now an increasing glimmer of hope that the previously intractable issues of conflict and instability in the Great Lakes Region would be resolved.1.10. The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) has funded over 1.7 million tertiary education students since its inception. The scheme provides financial aid to students from poor and working class families. To ensure that this is done in a sustainable manner, NSFAS collects student loan repayments.The repayments ensure that the scheme has funds available for future generations of students. This promotes access to, and success in, higher and further education and training, in pursuit of South Africa s national and human resource development goals.Cabinet encourages all NSFAS beneficiaries who are employed to contact NSFAS offices and start repaying their NSFAS loans. It is your responsibility to play your part in helping other students who are now in need of financial aid.2. Key Cabinet decisions2.1. Cabinet was briefed on the alternative Internet initiative to improve information management, called the Digital Object Architecture (DOA). Cabinet approved further investment in the development and uptake of the DOA initiative and for South Africa to be a Multi-Primary Administrator of the global DOA network. This technology contributes towards achieving the goals of the NDP by enhancing the capacity of the State to find innovative solutions to complex challenges. It also enhances service delivery through programmes such as e-government and cybersecurity.The benefits of using DOA to manage information will grow and build new local capabilities in Internet technology and develop tailor-made software solutions based on Open-Source Software. This will contribute to developing both the local software industry and improving information management systems and export earnings. A further benefit is that the DOA is compatible and interoperable with most existing architectures within the Internet. This will enable government to cut on the recurring costs of proprietary software systems.2.2. Following a request from the AU Commission, Cabinet approved for South Africa to host the African Internet Governance Forum (IGF) in October 2016. Internet Governance covers a wide range of social and political issues. These include participation in the online economy, intellectual property, cyber-security and privacy and access to key technical resources, such as domain names and Internet Protocol addresses that make Internet services possible.Hosting the African IGF provides a platform for Africa to develop strategies for participation in the global Internet economy which is critical for the development of economies in Africa. Currently the Internet economy is worth around R59 billion in South Africa.The forum also provides a platform for African governments to set the agenda to adopt a common position on Internet Governance. This follows the outcomes from the United Nations General Assembly World Summit on the Information Society High Level Review in December 2015.This reaffirms the Tunis Declaration, that Internet Governance is a global resource that should be managed in a multilateral, transparent and democratic process, with the full involvement of all stakeholders. African governments will also have an opportunity to engage on critical components of the Internet value chain with a view to promote the equitable distribution and use of Internet resources.3. Upcoming events3.1. Today, 23 June 2016 President Zuma is visiting Vulindlela Rural Enhanced People s Housing Process (EPHP) in Umsunduzi Local Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal to celebrate the delivery of more than four million government houses and subsidies since the dawn of our democracy in 1994.In KwaZulu-Natal, government has delivered over 700 000 houses and subsidies including 12 000 units in the Vulindlela Rural Housing Project which were built through the EPHP. The EPHP is a process where beneficiaries are actively involved in the decision-making over the housing process and product, and play a role in the building of their houses.3.2. President Zuma will undertake a State Visit to France between 10 and 12 July 2016, as part of further strengthening relations between the two countries. During the visit the President will attend the Centenary Commemoration of the Battle of Delville Wood of World War I, on 12 July 2016, where many South African soldiers lost their lives.While the Delville Wood Memorial is dedicated to South African soldiers, the apartheid government s policies at the time excluded black South Africans who died during the war while their white counterparts were buried at the Delville Wood Memorial.The memorial is undergoing a significant transformation to reflect the historical role played by black South Africans in the First and Second World Wars and to accord them the necessary recognition. In this regard, the President will also pay tribute to black soldiers at Arques-la-Bataille.3.3. President Zuma will lead a South African delegation to the 27th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the AU, scheduled to take place from 13 to 17 July 2016 in Kigali, Rwanda. The summit will take place under the theme:  2016, African Year of Human Rights with a particular focus on Women s Rights.  The year 2016 marks important milestones in the continental and global women s agenda for gender equality and women empowerment.Continentally, it is the 30th anniversary of the coming into force of the African Charter on Human and People s Rights in 1986 and the beginning of the second phase of the African Women s Decade 2010-2020. Globally, 2016 commemorates 36 years since the adoption of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 21st anniversary of the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, which is the key global policy on gender equality.The Heads of State and Government will consider the report of the AU Peace and Security Council on the state of peace in Africa. Furthermore, the summit will consider and approve the AU s 2017 proposed budget.3.4. President Zuma will also lead a South African government delegation to the Extra-Ordinary Summit of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Double Troika, to be held in Gaborone, Republic of Botswana on 28 June 2016. The summit is expected to consider the political and security situation in the SADC region, paying particular attention to the situation in the Kingdom of Lesotho.3.5. The country is ready to host the 21st International World Aids Conference from 18 to 22 July 2016 at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre in Durban. The beginning of the conference coincides with Nelson Mandela International Day on 18 July. South Africans are encouraged to share our story and showcase the positive turnaround in South Africa since the International AIDS Conference was last hosted in Durban in 2000.South Africa has invested heavily in its AIDS response in the last six years, resulting in the largest HIV-treatment programme in the world, which has saved millions of lives and increased life expectancy. Other achievements include the HIV Counselling and Testing (HCT) Campaign that tested 18 million South Africans for HIV and AIDS within a period of 18 months, with 10 million South Africans testing annually. AIDS-related deaths in South Africa declined from 320 000 in 2010 to 140 000 in 2014, and mother-to-child transmission of HIV was reduced from 70 000 babies in 2004 to less than 7 000 in 2015.TB is a key link and although TB deaths have declined from 70 000 in 2009 to less than 40 000 in 2014. TB remains the biggest killer of all infectious diseases in our country and globally. Government has successfully screened thousands of people in the vulnerable sectors of correctional services, mining and peri-mining communities.The prevention programme also prioritises girls and young women in the age group 15-24 years and aims to reduce infections; reduce teenage pregnancy; reduce sexual and gender-based violence; keep girls in school until matric; and increase economic opportunities for young women to try and wean them away from predatory older men.3.6. Government is currently observing the Public Service Week from the 22 and 26 June 2016, which is part of government s Batho Pele (People First) programme. The promotion of good ethics, high morale and pride in public servants encourages the culture of providing quality services. Government also notes that today, 23 June 2016 is Africa Public Service Day, which encourages different spheres of government to work together and make more efficient use of limited government resources for improved results.Cabinet encourages public servants to be at the forefront of the country s service delivery and to use the week to explore innovative ways to provide services to South Africans.3.7. Cabinet welcomes the decision by the Municipal Demarcation Board to host a conference on Demarcation and Spatial Transformation on 23 and 24 June 2016. The conference will include delegates from government departments, municipalities, as well as other countries. The conference provides a platform for a holistic discussion on demarcations, especially the issue of boundary changes and public participation. The voice of communities is essential in this process and all efforts to ensure greater and more inclusive public participation are welcomed.3.8. From Friday, 1 July 2016, taxpayers can officially commence completing and submitting their 2016 income tax returns. Tax Season has grown into an important partnership between government and taxpayers who make a vital contribution to our country s revenue base.It represents the single biggest annual engagement between the South African Revenue Service and taxpayers, when more than four million taxpayers submit their income tax returns. Cabinet encourages all taxpayers to submit their annual income tax returns from 1 July 2016. It is through the efforts of compliant taxpayers that South Africa recorded a historic revenue collection of R1 trillion for the 2014/15 financial year.4. Cabinet s position on key issues in the environment4.1. Cabinet condemns the recent spate of violence in and around the City of Tshwane and calls on citizens to refrain from breaking the law and violent protests. No amount of grievance can justify violence and the destruction of property. Those found guilty of perpetrating such criminal acts will face the full might of the law.South Africa is a constitutional democracy where each citizen has the opportunity to participate in democratic processes. Such criminal behaviour infringes on the rights and free movement of others. Cabinet calls on communities to work with law-enforcement agencies to root out those who disrespect others  constitutional rights.4.2. The Constitutional Court judgment in the matter of Mhlophe versus Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) paves the way for the local government elections to proceed on 3 August 2016 using the voter s roll certified by the IEC following the proclamation of the election date. Cabinet calls on all registered voters to exercise their hard won democratic rights and elect the local government representatives of their choice. Government will work with the IEC and all other stakeholders to ensure that the judgment of the Constitutional Court is fully implemented.4.3. Cabinet welcomed the announcement by Eskom that it had synchronised all four units at its new Ingula hydroelectric power plant to the national grid ahead of schedule. The R25-billion project enhances the country s future energy security by adding 1 332 Megawatts during times of peak demand. The plant is on track for full commercial operation in 2017.4.4. Cabinet welcomed back the firefighters who were deployed to Canada to help fight wildlands fires. The South African team was demobilised following heavy rains. Working on Fire is a government-funded, job-creation programme focusing on implementing Integrated Fire Management in South Africa.More than 5 000 young men and women have been fully trained as wildfire firefighters and are stationed in more than 200 bases across South Africa. Firefighters are recruited from marginalised communities and trained in fire awareness and education, prevention and fire-suppression skills. Similar government programmes include  Working for Water  and  Working for Energy  where government invests in labour-intensive activities that create jobs and protect our natural resources. Following their return, the Department of Environmental Affairs is investigating the pay dispute by the firefighters for a fair outcome for all stakeholders.4.5. Cabinet sends its sincere condolences to the following:Family and friends of radio and television personality Hope Zinde who worked as a journalist at the SABC in the 90s and was also a former SABC board member.  Government and the people of the United States of America following the shooting in Orlando, Florida, which left about 50 people dead and scores injured.4.6. The sanction of retired estate agent Penny Sparrow by the Umzinto Equality Court in KwaZulu-Natal, who was found guilty of hate speech, is a reminder that such behaviour will not be tolerated and that our courts will steadfastly uphold the rights of all victims of racism, especially those who are voiceless and unable to defend themselves.Cabinet is concerned that even though we are 22 years into democracy, the South African Human Rights Commission reports an increase in reported incidents of open racism and hate speech. Cabinet calls on South Africans to remember that it is our diversity that makes us strong. We should all strive to build non-racial society.5.

Implementation of Key Government Programmes1.1. In improving the lives of our people, Cabinet welcomes the launch of the Ncora Bulk Water Treatment Works Project in the Eastern Cape by President Jacob Zuma. The R64 million water treatment plant is estimated to benefit 17 887 families from 208 villages in the four surrounding area. It has created 188 jobs, with local people, youth and women being major beneficiaries.The launch of the R18 billion Vaal Gamagara Water Supply Scheme refurbishment and upgrade project in Northern Cape by the Minister of Water and Sanitation, Nomvula Mokonyane will serve close to 150, 000 people in 3 towns and 22 villages on completion. Also, the launch of the R15 million Jericho Rural Water Supply Project has increased the security of water supply to the communities of Jericho in Madibeng Local Municipality.1.2. Government s investment in transport infrastructure is creating a safe, reliable, efficient and affordable public transport service across the country. The spin-off from improved travel conditions is greater investor confidence and economic development.The official opening of the R190 million investment Ballito Interchange and the P455 main road upgrade by the Minister for Transport, Dipuo Peters are models for smart co-funding with R123 million from SANRAL and R67 million from the KwaDukuza Municipality. These serve as catalysts for further growth and investment with the P455 main road upgrade unlocking the development of a new R1 billion retail complex which is due for completion in 2017.New state-of-the-art trains procured by the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa will be launched later in the year. These trains will assist with the improvement of the services and train availability for the Mamelodi train commuters. An additional 70 new commuter buses will be procured in the City of Johannesburg which will better connect residents and improve economic efficiency in the country s financial hub.These investments are changing our urban landscape in response to the needs of our people.1.3. On 16 July 2016, Minister of Science and Technology, Naledi Pandor will commission 16 dishes to expand MeerKAT, a project of Square Kilometre Array South Africa (SKA SA), 90 kilometres northwest of Carnarvon. The MeerKAT telescope has produced remarkable images of the sky using just four of the eventual 64 dishes installed; revealing never before seen radio galaxies in the distant universe. The scientific promise of MeerKAT is receiving worldwide interest and is now within our reach. It is a testament to the dedicated work of hundreds of engineers, scientists, managers and other staff, as well as of the South African and international industrial partners, and the support of the government and people of South Africa.1.4. The National Arts Festival hosted annually in Grahamstown takes place over 11 days from 30 June to 10 July 2016. This multidisciplinary festival, the biggest annual celebration of the arts on the African continent, contributes in realising the National Development Plan which advocates that  arts and culture open powerful spaces for debate about where a society finds itself and where it is going .It is supported through the Mzansi Golden Economy strategy, which repositions the cultural industries in South Africa to effectively and comprehensively contribute to economic growth and job creation. Through the Mzansi Golden Economy Open Call process, the Department of Arts and Culture is also establishing a Debut Fund for younger artists. The aim is to create opportunities for young artists to publish their first book, produce their first play, produce their first album or host their first exhibition.1.5. In bringing crime prevention services closer to the people, Cabinet welcomes the newly built Keimoes police station in the Northern Cape, which serves an estimated 23 000 citizens.In Phola in Mpumalanga, the donation of a police station to the community by Eskom s Kusile power station in partnership with KCW JV contractor demonstrated the impact of working together. The construction of the station, valued at R3 million, has created job opportunities and empowered people with skills and knowledge to create a safer environment.1.6. South Africa hosted the Commonwealth Local Government Forum   Southern Africa Regional conference on 28 to 29 June 2016. This conference convened under the theme,  Igniting Sustainable and People Centered Socio-Economic Development in sub-Saharan Africa , reflected on the role of African governments in championing the new development Agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals which conclude in 2030, and realise its objectives within the context of Africa Agenda 2063. The SDGs define the development agenda at local level to be essentially about making municipal spaces more socially inclusive, economically productive, environmentally sustainable and resilient to climate change and other risks.1.7. We welcome the outcomes of the first ever Municipal Demarcation Board (MDB) conference on Demarcation and Spatial Transformation that took place from 23   24 June 2016. The conference was convened under the theme,  Reviewing the Past and Mapping the Future  focusing attention on key issues related to demarcation and  examining challenges facing the metropolitan system of governance and the necessity of delimiting wards every five years.

Cabinet was also briefed on the on-going preparations for the Third United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urbanisation (Habitat III) to be held by the General Assembly of the United Nations in Quito in Ecuador from 17 to 20 October 2016.Habitat III aims to secure a renewed global commitment to addressing housing and sustainable urbanisation for the next 20 years through the adoption of a forward-looking, action orientated outcome agreement. Cabinet supports the Common African Position on Habitat III that will be tabled at African Union Summit of Heads of State and Government in Kigali, in July 2016. This forms the basis for South Africa s negotiating position. Consultations are ongoing to inform a South African Habitat III outcome position document.South Africa also contributed to the international preparations by hosting a Habitat III Thematic Conference on informal settlements in April 2016 under the theme  Leading change in the City: From slums to integrated, safe, resilient and sustainable human settlements  which adopted the Pretoria Declaration as a formal input into the Habitat III draft outcome document.2.3. The decision by the Minister of Trade and Industry to designate the Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone in the Vhembe Region of Limpopo, and to grant a Special Economic Zone Licence to the Limpopo Economic Development Agency was ratified by Cabinet.

Cabinet s position on key issues in the environment4.1. South Africans noted with appreciation that President Jacob Zuma declared 3 August 2016 as a public holiday to enable all eligible and registered voters to vote freely on the day. While the IEC will endeavour to ensure that elections are free and fair, it is the primary responsibility of all the stakeholders including communities and political parties. Cabinet would like to urge all South Africans to ensure peace and calm ahead of, during and post the 2016 local government elections. The law enforcement agencies will not tolerate any disruptive actions aimed at disenfranchising voters. We encourage all registered voters who will not be able to vote on 3rd of August to apply for a special vote with the IEC.4.2. All South Africans are encouraged to participate in the nomination process for the 2017 National Orders Awards. National Orders are the highest awards that a country, through its President, bestows on its citizens and eminent foreign nationals.Members of the public are invited to nominate persons they believe deserve to receive the country s highest honours. Members of the public must attach a short motivation on the person nominated and nominations forms can be accessed on The Presidency website.4.3. We welcomed the findings from the 2016 State of the South African Cities Report (SOCR) released on 22 June 2016 by the South African Cities Network. The SOCR presents a 5-year perspective on the performance and conditions of the country s largest cities and sets the development Agenda by communicating essential messages about the planning, development and management of cities to the next generation of civic leaders. This report elevates actions to make our cities better, more inclusive and productive places for those who live in them.4.4. Government interventions are beginning to bear fruit and municipalities supported through initiatives such as Back to Basics are responding positively and showing signs of improvement. It is a further indication of the progress made in deconstructing apartheid spatial planning and improving service delivery. It underscores the many achievements that have transformed our urban landscape into democratic spaces in which all citizens are free to interact. This echoes the Auditor-General s Report on Municipal Finances that showed a considerable improvement in Audit Outcomes in the past 5 financial years from 2010/11 to 2014/15. The 2015 Financial Census of Municipalities report released recently by Statistics South Africa is another indication that government is able to provide quality basic services to the people. According to Stats SA s 2016 Community Survey, the country s growing population is better off than before.4.5. Cabinet reaffirmed its support for media freedom, freedom of expression and the right of any person to access information in South Africa. These rights, well enshrined in the Constitution, will always be upheld and protected by all.The role of the SABC as the public broadcaster remains vital for the development of our young democracy. The current discussion over the SABC s editorial decisions regarding the broadcasting of images of violence and destruction of property should be held in a constructive manner that would serve to strengthen our democracy.Cabinet remains confident that the public broadcaster will continue to serve the interests of all the people of South Africa.4.6. South Africa's improvement by 14 places in the World Bank's 2016 Logistics Performance Index tells us that South Africa is certainly open for business. South Africa stands at 20th of 160 countries assessed by the survey, moving up from 34 in 2014. The ease of movement for goods and services contribute significantly to a country s competitiveness, particularly as a destination for investment.4.7. Cabinet received a report from the Ministers of Mineral Resources, Labour and Finance following their constructive engagement with stakeholders in the banking industry. The outcome of this report will be communicated in due course.4.8. Cabinet welcomes the 2016 Community Survey Report by Statistics South Africa that shows the progress we have made as a nation in key areas of service delivery, particularly in life expectancy of our people.These statistics are an important yardstick to inform strategic planning for government particularly the new and incoming administration of local government following the elections on 3rd of August. Government will intervene to address the challenges highlighted in the report through the National Development Plan Vision 2030, which is the plan of the people by the people.4.9 Cabinet congratulates the following:Nkosinathi Maphumulo, popularly known as Black Coffee, for becoming the first South African to win the prestigious Black Entertainment Television (BET) Best International Act: Africa Award.Bafana Bafana for winning the 2016 Edition of the COSAFA Cup. The team which comprised mostly of under 23 players bodes well for the country s future success in the international arena.The Springboks on their victory over Ireland in the third test to win the series.The winners of the 18th National Science and Technology Forum Awards which are the most significant science, engineering, technology and innovation (SETI) awards in South Africa. The awards honour outstanding contributions to SETI by encouraging and rewarding excellence.The City of Tshwane which received international recognition at the World Wi-Fi Day Awards for Most Innovative City or Government Program to bridge the Digital Divide. The awards were held at the Wireless Global Congress in the United Kingdom. The Tshwane Free Wi-Fi (knowns as TshWi-Fi) brought 1.8 million citizens in the Capital City online in the biggest deployment of municipal Free Wi-Fi on the African continent. The rollout was the result of a partnership with Project Isizwe.4.10 Cabinet extends its condolences:To countries which have experienced recent terror attacks, including Somalia, Turkey, Bangladesh and Iraq. South Africa stands firmly with the international community in condemning all forms of terrorism.On the passing of highly regarded academic, author and thought leader, Professor Adam Small.To the family and friends of Limpopo Agriculture MEC Joy Matshoge who died in a car accident in Mokopane, Limpopo.To the family of accomplished businessman Don Mkhwanazi who played an instrumental role in black economic empowerment and driving economic transformation in the country.

Statement on the Cabinet Lekgotla of August 2016,22 Aug 2016,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-lekgotla-august-2016-22-aug-2016-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-lekgotla-august-2016-22-aug-2016-0000,"Cabinet held its Lekgotla from 16 to 19 August 2016 at Sefako Makgatho Presidential Guesthouse in Pretoria.The August 2016 Cabinet Lekgotla marked the halfway point of the Fifth Administration s term of office.Cabinet Lekgotla took time to congratulate South Africa for a peaceful, free and fair Local Government Election that took place on the 3rd of August 2016.The Lekgotla took place in the context of a continuing sub-optimal economic outlook occasioned by various internal and external factors, as well as an ever-present threat to our sovereign credit ratings.The Lekgotla provided an opportunity for Cabinet to collectively reflect on the implementation of Government s programme of action and provided crucial lessons for a much nuanced and effective implementation of the National Development Plan, which underpins the Medium Term Strategic Framework 2014-2019.Firm decisions were taken on concrete actionable plans which will take implementation of the Medium-Term Strategic Framework 2014-2019 and the Nine Point Plan to a higher level. These plans require all sectors, which includes government, civil society, business and labour, to roll up their sleeves and work together to ensure that together we take South Africa on a sustainable social development and economic growth trajectory.Concrete plans have been put in place to deepen implementation in the next financial year, which also allows government to align its Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) to the implementation of the Nine-Point Plan.The Cabinet Lekgotla focused on six key areas:1. First, a global and domestic macro-economic analysis was deliberated on together with further proposals for economic and fiscal consolidation in the next year and beyond. This enabled Cabinet to locate its economic growth and fiscal decisions within the global economic context.1.1. Global recovery is still expected to strengthen but to a lesser degree than previously estimated, as Brexit impacts unfavourably on global growth. Sub-Saharan Africa is reflecting challenging macroeconomic conditions as its major economies adjust to lower commodity process.1.2. Other risks include potential vulnerability in the Euro banking system; financial stability in emerging markets; geopolitical risks, climatic and health risks.1.3. The medium-term framework sustains social gains in a weakening economic environment. Government remains committed to meeting its medium-term fiscal targets and will take additional steps to do so as conditions warrant.1.4. Future commitments of the state will depend on reforms that are based on effective governance, and with participation from the private-sector.2. Second, the Cabinet Lekgotla Cabinet also reflected on the implementation of the Nine-Point Plan to grow the South African economy which was announced by President Jacob Zuma in his State of the Nation Address in February 2015.2.1. The focus was on key programmes and projects to deepen the implementation of the Nine-Point Plan in the next financial year. This led to the adoption of key high-impact projects for the next financial year and beyond which aim to have a substantial positive impact on the economy through unlocking key levers.2.2. Cabinet took strategic decisions to secure higher impact implementation of the Industrial Policy Action Plan including:That the Department of Public Enterprises and National Treasury will consolidate procurement for locomotives into a single institution (Transnet) to ensure efficiency and compliance with the localisation requirements.Finalising the evaluation of financial incentives for business to strengthen conditionalities and achieve greater value for money to enhance more inclusive growth.A trade statistics architecture developed by the South African Reserve Bank, National Treasury, SARS and Stats SA will identify and hold illicit financial flows.Introducing legislative amendments to implement the 30% set asides (a new Procurement Bill developed by National Treasury) by March 2017 and unlock the potential of SMME s, cooperatives and the township and rural enterprises.Implementing the new Preferential Procurement Regulations by end August 2016 as an interim measure to this radical intervention.2.3. Government will continue to focus on labour-intensive sectors, including the need for various mechanisms to support greater impact on jobs, such as the use of our incentive programmes, amongst others: clothing, textiles, leather and footwear value-chain; agro-processing and business process services.2.4. The successful Oceans Economy intervention will scale up projects to expand coastal and marine tourism in order to realise significant job creation.2.5. To resolve the energy challenges in country, the Department of Energy will complete the Integrated Energy Plan and Integrated Resource Plan for Electricity by the end of 2016 to provide certainty on electricity pricing and investment in the generation capacity.2.6. The Inter Ministerial Committee on Investment, Chaired by President Jacob Zuma will coordinate 40 priority investment projects across government. These 40 projects include the agro-processing and agri-parks, energy and infrastructure, manufacturing and services projects. These projects were selected based on having a high-scale economic impact linked to the Nine-Point Plan; being able to take-off within the next two years; and able to crowd-in further investment and community benefits.2.7. Department of Trade and Industry will finalise the strategy for the deployment of locally developed technologies by the end of 2016. Further, the Department of Science and Technology and the National Treasury will secure additional funds to sustain and expand the Sector Innovation Fund through the Economic Competitive Support Package.2.8. Priority continues to be placed on water saving and minimisation of water losses. By September 2016, agreements are to be completed with municipalities with high water losses, to facilitate placement of agents, and a clear funding model is to be completed.2.9. In fast tracking the implementation of the South African Connect Strategy to connect schools, health facilities and government offices, the ICT Policy will be finalised and approved. A Broadband War Room will be established to accelerate implementation.3. Thirdly, the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission (PICC) MANCO presented the Lekgotla with a high-level report on the implementation of the national infrastructure development programme as well as concrete infrastructure implementation plans in the next financial year and beyond. The work of the PICC is closely aligned to that of the Nine-Point Plan.4. Fourthly, a summarised progress report on the implementation of the Medium-Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) 2014-2019 was presented, which concentrated on a review of key aspects of the MTSF 2014-2019 so as to improve implementation in the next financial year.4.1. Whilst acknowledging the work done to date in the 9-Point Plan, it was also acknowledged that accelerated implementation is necessary to enhance economic growth.4.2. An action plan to ensure greater expenditure on municipal infrastructure maintenance and to enforce proper financial asset management will be developed and implemented to extend the lifespan and quality of our infrastructure assets.4.3. Cabinet resolved to initiate a national process towards the negotiation of a Social Compact between labour, business and government to stimulate economic growth and mitigate job losses.5. Fifth, over and above the alignment of the MTEF to the Nine-Point Plan, the National Treasury and the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation presented their recommendations on work done in the past year to align the national budget to the National Development Plan as well as to the Medium-Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) 2014-2019.5.1. Government has identified a set of budget priorities for 2017/18 which focusses on maintaining infrastructure spend, strengthening support for skills development and maintaining real levels of spending on the poor.5.2. Work on identifying efficiencies and savings over the remainder of the MTEF will continue.6. Sixth, the Lekgotla also reflected on progress made and the next steps in the reform of state-owned companies (SOCs) since the Cabinet Lekgotla of February 2015. This is in view of the important role played by SOCs in the radical socio-economic transformation advocated in the programme of the Fifth Administration.6.1. The implementation of the stabilisation programme has progressed with varying degrees. Strengthening of leadership to execute the turnaround strategies remains critical.6.2. Eskom has largely been stabilised with both operational and financial performance improving.6.3. The Inter Ministerial Committee will continue to oversee thirteen (13) other SOC specific interventions.6.4. The Lekgotla placed priority on the finalisation of the Shareholder Ownership Model, which will inform the legislative framework for SOC reform by November 2016.6.5. Work will also start for the creation of the Presidential SOCs Coordinating Council which will provide President Zuma line of sight on strategic decisions and interventions to create SOCs that play a transformative role in a capable developmental state.The decisions and plans from the Cabinet Lekgotla will bolster implementation of government s programme of action and gives confidence that South Africa is on a sustainable social development and economic growth trajectory.7. Special Official Funeral7.1 Cabinet is saddened by the passing away of the former Minister of Sports and Recreation, Reverend Arnold Makhenkesi Stofile. As a veteran political activist, he participated in all pillars of government, at various provincial, national and international structures.7.2 President Jacob Zuma declared that Reverend Stofile will be accorded a Special Official Funeral in terms of Category 2 of the State Official and Provincial Official Funeral Policy. As we remember this great leader of our country, the official memorial service for the late Rev. Stofile is being held today, 11am at the Abbotsford Christian Centre in East London. President Zuma ordered that the National Flag be flown at half-mast at all flag posts in the Republic of South Africa on the day of the funeral.7.3 The late Rev. Stofile will be laid to rest at the funeral service taking place at University of Fort Hare where he was Chancellor, on Thursday 25 August 2016 in Alice, Eastern Cape Province. President Zuma will deliver the eulogy at the funeral of the late Reverend Stofile.We convey our deepest condolences to his family and friends during this painful and difficult period.Lala Ngoxolo tata Stofile.Enquiries:Donald LiphokoCell: 082 901 0766"

The Comprehensive Implementation Plan on Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition, has one of six global targets for nutrition to increase the rates of exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months to at least 50% by 2025.Breastfeeding is one of the best value investments in child survival. Sub-optimal breastfeeding practices contribute annually to 800 000 deaths (13% of all deaths) among under-five children in the developing world as well as to the high prevalence of malnutrition, which is a major public health challenge in Africa.2.5. Cabinet approved for the Department of Health to host the 17th International Conference of Drug Regulatory Authorities, from 27 November to 2 December 2016, in cooperation with the World Health Organisation (WHO).

On 12 May 2016 a final NEDLAC report on the BMA Bill, 2016 was approved by the NEDLAC Management Committee. The Bill was certified on 18 May 2016 by the Office of the Chief State Law Advisor for introduction into Parliament. Cabinet noted that the BMA Bill, 2016 was subsequently introduced into Parliament on 25 May 2016 and the first deliberations on this Bill took place in Parliament on 6 August 2016.Cabinet approved that the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) and the South African Revenue Service (SARS) fast-track the finalisation of the Memorandum of Understanding relating to the secondment of relevant SARS staff to DHA to support current border management and coordination efforts in the border environment.3.

The introduction of the Judicial Matters Amendment Bill, 2016 into Parliament which seeks to amend numerous laws having a bearing on the administration of justice in order to address practical and technical issues, to ensure the smooth administration of justice has also been approved.The amendments are of such a nature that it is not practical to promote individual Amendment Acts to effect these amendments to the laws in question. The amendments are of a diverse nature and can be linked to the following key targets of the National Development Plan, namely to ensure that all people are and feel safe based on an independent and fair criminal justice system; social cohesion; to realise a developmental, capable and ethical state that treats citizens with dignity; and economic inclusion.4. Upcoming events4.1. President Jacob Zuma will lead South Africa s delegation to the 71st United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 71) between 13 and 26 September in New York under the theme: ""The Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world.""This presents an opportunity for member states to take stock of the effectiveness of the United Nations, particularly as the organisation recently celebrated its 70th anniversary. Deliberations are expected on UN reform, including on the revitalisation of the UNGA; improvement of the work of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC); and reform of the UN Security Council (UNSC) to expand its membership in both the permanent and non-permanent categories. This will also be the last time that Ban Ki-moon addresses the UN General Assembly as its Secretary-General.4.2. The South African Police Service (SAPS) will host the annual National Commemoration Day on 4 September 2016, to remember all members of the SAPS who lost their lives between the 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016, while performing their duties in an endeavour to ensure safety and security in South Africa.5. Cabinet s position on key issues in the environment5.1. Cabinet expressed its concern over continued public spats between various parties on the matter related to the Hawks investigation into SARS-related issues. Cabinet called on all those concerned, including members of Cabinet acting in various capacities, to exercise restraint and cease making public statements directed at any protagonist in this matter. Cabinet calls on all parties to act with dignity and decorum and to respectfully approach the relevant parties instead of taking to public platforms.5.2. Cabinet joins President Zuma in expressing full confidence in the Minister of Finance who, together with various other members of the Executive, business, Labour and civil society, has been doing a sterling job in building confidence in our economy among domestic and foreign investors. Cabinet equally called on all parties to respect and cooperate with state organs tasked with law enforcement.5.3. The Executive continues to do all it can to protect the economy, and the important developmental work that state-owned entities are responsible for. All state agencies have a responsibility to carry out their mandate in a manner that does not destabilise the work of government or negatively affect the economy.5.4. President Jacob Zuma attended the Sixth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD VI) Summit was held in Nairobi, Kenya from 27 to 28 August 2016. This was the first time that TICAD was held in Africa since its inception in 1993.TICAD-VI afforded the Heads of State and Governments from Africa an important opportunity to monitor the progress and implementation of previous TICAD agreements which aim to speed up the growth and development of Africa.TICAD-VI also took place in the first year of the implementation of the global and regional development agendas, namely the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Agenda 2063 and its First Ten-Year Implementation Plan. Being fully in line with these development agendas, TICAD-VI discussed thematic issues that Africa has been facing since the last TICAD-V in Yokohama, Japan in 2013. These include industrialisation, health, and social stability.Cabinet welcomes Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s pledge that Japan will mobilise a total of $30 billion in private- and public-sector funds to invest in Africa over next three years to boost infrastructure building in Africa.The assembly made extensive and deep discussions on private-sector investment, the industrialisation of economies in Africa, creating sustainable economic structures, health and prevention against pandemics such as Ebola and Zika, the fight against terrorism, educating and empowering poverty-stricken youths to prevent them from being lured to extremist groups and terrorism.The heads of state and government reiterated their commitment to continue strengthening TICAD process with the guiding principles of open and inclusive forum, engagement of multi-stakeholders, alignment with African prior agendas, emphasis on people centered development, and effective implementation with integrated follow-up mechanisms.5.5. The incidents of racism levelled against Pretoria High School for Girls are of concern. Cabinet commends the bravery of the learners for exposing the racism and prejudice at the school. They are indeed activists of social change, who are needed in taking our country away from its divisive past and closer to realising the objectives of a more united South Africa.We call on all South Africans to respect each other and unite against the divisiveness of racism in our society. Our democratic journey is built on tolerance and respect.5.6. We also join millions of South Africans in congratulating Team South Africa for a sterling performance at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. The team did the country proud by winning ten medals across various disciplines, including two gold medals.  The blistering performance by Wayde Van Niekerk in winning gold in the 400m and smashing the world record, and the stunning run by our golden girl Caster Semenya in the 800m will live long in our collective memories.5.7. Cabinet congratulates South Africans and the IEC for their part in ensuring yet another successful Local Government Election. Across the country, councils have met to elect mayors, speakers and chief whips in a resounding vote for democracy in action.Cabinet encourages citizens to continue to participate through Ward Committees and other mechanisms that include communities in local government.5.8. The announcement of a R1, 5 billion fine payable by ArcelorMittal, the country's largest steel-maker, for price-fixing and collusion in the steel industry is the largest single fine imposed against a single company by the competition authorities.The company also undertook, as part of the settlement with the authorities, to invest R4,6 billion in new capital spending to upgrade its plants and improve competitiveness. The settlement further provides for a pricing mechanism that will cap the company's margin on flat steel products for a period of five years.This is part of a crackdown against abuse of market power and price-fixing that undermines the performance of the economy, imposes unnecessary costs on downstream factories and damages local jobs. Government remains committed to promoting investment-led economic growth, not collusion-induced economic stagnation.5.9. We call on all South Africans to use water efficiently and conserve it; by working together we can ensure a steady supply of water and also protect our vital water infrastructure.There are persistent drought conditions in several parts of the country with Gauteng now being impacted with the Integrated Vaal River System under severe pressure. To deal with the current situation, the Department of Water and Sanitation working with SALGA, CoGTA and municipalities will impose restrictions on water consumption in Ekurhuleni, Johannesburg, Tshwane and Mogale City.Urban supply will be reduced by 15 per cent and water for irrigation will be reduced by 20 per cent.  The restrictions are unavoidable and will remain in place to secure water supply until the situation eases. 5.10. The findings of the Mid-Year Population Estimates by Statistics SA showed South Africa s population grew to 55.9 million people with life expectancy at 62 years and infant mortality estimated at 33.7 per 1 000 live births.Cabinet was concerned over the increase in the HIV prevalence rate from 11.2 per cent last year to 12.7 per cent in 2016 translating into an estimated 7.03 million people living with HIV.Cabinet appeals to all South Africans to work with government to prevent new infections by getting tested at least once a year, practising safer sex and for men and boys to heed the call and to consider medical circumcision.5.11. Cabinet noted the Constitutional Court ruling on the Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Act, which was enacted in 2014, to reopen the country s land restitution process.The Court gave Parliament two years to re-enact the law or to pass a new Act. The ruling means no new applications can be lodged until a new Act re-opening the lodgement of claims is passed.The Commission on Restitution of Land Rights will be conducting a media briefing to guide the way forward following the ruling.5.12. South Africa is hosting the 35th International Geological Congress at the Cape Town International Convention Centre from 27 August to 4 September 2016.The Congress aims to contribute to the advancement of fundamental and applied research in the geological sciences. The event will showcase the region s world-famous geology and geoheritage together with its geological and scenic sites. Geological challenges in the field will also be examined.5.13. Cabinet conveys its condolences to the family and friends of the former Cabinet Minister and Premier of the Eastern Cape Province, Reverend Arnold Makhenkesi Stofile. Reverend Stofile was a veteran political activist who participated in all pillars of the South African struggle, from the underground and mass mobilisation drives, to international solidarity and the formal constitution of government structures.Cabinet also expresses its condolences to the families of the South African National Defence Force members who lost their lives in the bus accident at Clarens in the Free State.Cabinet joins President Jacob Zuma in sending condolences to H.E President Sergio Mattarella, the Government and the people of Italy following the earthquake that struck central Italy, which resulted in the deaths of citizens and extensive damage in several towns. We also wish the injured a speedy recovery.6. AppointmentsAll appointments are subject to the verification of qualifications and the relevant clearance.6.1.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 14 September 2016,15 Sep 2016,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-14-september-2016-15-sep-2016-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-14-september-2016-15-sep-2016-0000,"1. Implementation of key government programmes1.1. Cabinet is encouraged by the growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) of 3.3% in the second quarter of 2016; released by Statistics South Africa. The 8.1% increase in manufacturing and 11.8% in mining and quarrying demonstrates the resilience of the economy in this tough economic environment. The GDP grew by R25 billion more than the first quarter of 2016 to an estimated R1 068 billion.We reiterate the call for government, business and civil society to consolidate the social compact in the implementation of the National Development Plan (NDP), through the Nine-Point Plan so as to further counteract the current economic conditions and stimulate growth to support the economy and help save jobs.This a clear demonstration that when all partners   government, business and labour   work together we can achieve economic growth and ultimately create much-needed jobs.1.2. Cabinet welcomed the announcement that the second 800 megawatts (MW) unit at the Medupi Power Station project in Limpopo had been synchronised to the grid. Unit 5 of the power station, which is one of six being built as part of the 4 800 MW project, will become commercially operational by March 2018.This is the second of the power station s six units to come on stream. The first unit, or Unit 6, began feeding power into the grid in March 2015 and has entered commercial operation. The entire six-unit Medupi project is expected to be completed in 2020.This contributes to the stabilisation of the grid which strengthens reliable electricity supply for South Africa. Cabinet congratulated Eskom for the synchronisation milestone, which is part of a broader build-programme acceleration, being driven by the new leadership. This contributes to operational and financial sustainability for Eskom.1.3. Cabinet reiterates its commitment to the Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme, which will develop and produce a significant share of the new electricity capacity as a critical component that underpins economic activity and growth.This will contribute to the diversification of both the supply and nature of energy production. In addition to introducing new skills and securing new investment in the industry, it will also benchmark performance and pricing.This supports the NDP, which identifies the need for South Africa to invest in a strong network of economic infrastructure designed to support the country s medium- and long-term economic and social objectives.\1.4. Cabinet also noted the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa and China Communications Construction Company Limited to explore various infrastructure development initiatives, including the Moloto Rail Development Corridor which links Gauteng and Mpumalanga.The MoU was signed at the 2nd Investment Africa Investment Forum attended by President Jacob Zuma in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, in China.The project will serve as a catalyst for economic development initiatives within and around the corridor to resolve challenges of safety, efficiency, reliability, affordability and overall integration with other public transport services. It would also improve the quality of life for people in the area by cutting the long commuting distances.1.5. Cabinet was apprised on the progress reports for quarter one, for the period April to June 2016, on the implementation of Outcomes. Government recorded progress which is making an impact on the lives of people while also addressing problems affecting service delivery.Implementation of the Outcome Programme of Action implements the objectives of the NDP, which is South Africa s blueprint to take us closer to realising Vision 2030. This translates into the targets set out in the Medium Term Strategic Framework, which is government s first five-year implementation plan of the NDP 2030, covering the period from 2014 to 2019.There have been improvements in health status reflected in key population health indicators such as enhanced life expectancy, reduced under-five mortality and reduced maternal mortality. There has been improved provision of basic services, including grid and non-grid electricity connections, potable water in dwellings, sanitation and solid waste management. However, there are still backlogs in some places. Since 1994 there has been sustained and improved provision of social assistance to over 16 million beneficiaries, and evidence that this is having a significant impact on the lives of the poor.The GCIS is coordinating with departments to secure Cluster Media briefings to unpack highlights from the quarterly reports.1.6. Cabinet welcomes the Imbizo hosted by the Minister in The Presidency for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation and Chairperson of the National Planning Commission, Jeff Radebe, on interventions implemented to fast-track the payment of suppliers (or service providers) by government within the stipulated 30-day period.Since the establishment of the Special Unit in the Department of Planning Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) to tackle the problem of non-payment of suppliers within the required 30 days, the number of legitimate invoices paid as at June 2016 was 17 668 to the value of R340 million.The DPME and National Treasury have also devoted more resources to the effort of addressing the challenges of payment of suppliers. To this end, a walk-in centre has been established at National Treasury s offices to attend to suppliers  queries.Additionally, the DPME special unit and its partners are rolling out a targeted support programme to identified struggling departments to understand and address the challenges that lead to non-payment or late payments of suppliers.During these visits, the entire value chain of payment of invoices is assessed, blockages are identified and departments are assisted with implementation of improvement measures.2. Key Cabinet decisions2.1. South Africa will host the 17th Meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP17) to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) at the Sandton Convention Centre from 24 September to 5 October 2016. With 181 Parties, CITES remains one of the world's most powerful tools for biodiversity conservation through the regulation of trade in wild fauna and flora. CITES Parties and observers are expected to engage in robust discussions and come up with resolutions that take forward the work already underway around the trade in flora and fauna.South Africa is a world leader in the field of wildlife conservation through its active participation in multilateral environmental agreements such as CITES, the Convention on Migratory Species and the Convention on Biological Diversity. Our country s unique system of protected areas comprises roughly 5,5% of the country's surface area, six World Heritage Sites and four biosphere reserves.2.2. The Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services, Dr Siyabonga Cwele, will lead the South African delegation at the 26th World Postal Congress of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) to be held in Istanbul, Turkey from 20 September to 7 October 2016. The UPU is a specialised agency of the United Nations (UN) that focusses on modernising the postal sector and diversifying postal products to sustain a universal postal territory that meets the needs of the 21st century.This congress is critical for South Africa, as the South African Post Office is key a player of government service delivery and is aligned to the NDP, through the national address and roll-out of financial and government services to rural and underserved communities.2.3. Cabinet was briefed on progress regarding preparations for the Commonwealth Games 2022 to be staged in the City of Durban.Investment in infrastructure for the Games is expected to contribute to the lasting benefits of the host city, which will also make use of the infrastructure legacy of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. This added exposure to global markets will also provide opportunities to attract and enhance tourism and foreign direct investment. The 2022 Commonwealth Games is expected to deliver up to R20 billion in output to the economy, translating into an additional R11 billion GDP growth.This further positions the country as a sport tourism destination and also provides opportunities for Team South Africa.2.4. Cabinet noted the subpoena served on the Secretary of Cabinet by the Public Protector. The subpoena requests the Secretary of Cabinet to provide the declarations of Cabinet members and the minutes of Cabinet, in the period November 2015 to April 2016, that record the appointment of acting Ministers while the incumbent Ministers were abroad.Cabinet agreed to provide the Public Protector with the declarations. However, since the President of South Africa appoints Ministers and Deputy Ministers under sections 91 and 98 of the Constitution, such matters have not come before Cabinet and therefore these records have not been minuted as Cabinet decisions.3. Bills3.1. Publication of the National Liquor Amendment Bill of 2016 was approved for wider public consultation. This amends the National Liquor Act, 2003 (Act 59 of 2003). This was approved together with the final National Liquor Policy, which addresses challenges hampering the effectiveness of the Act and facilitated the drafting of the Bill.The Bill addresses the socio-economic impact of liquor, the slow pace of transformation, standardisation of key aspects of regulation and improved regulatory collaboration, eradicating the manufacturing and trading in illegal and illicit alcohol as well as challenges regarding regulatory capacity within the National Liquor Authority.This intervention also focuses on reducing socio-economic harms and other costs of liquor abuse, restructuring the liquor industry and enhancing cooperation between all spheres of government.It is aligned to the NDP priorities of ensuring effective governance, social protection and employment creation. It will amongst others, prevent illegal trading, enhance education and awareness programmes, and assist in enhanced programmes on rehabilitating those who are addicted.3.2. Cabinet also approved the draft National Gambling Amendment Bill of 2016 for wider public comment. The Bill addresses challenges hampering effectiveness of the National Gambling Act, 2004 (Act 7 of 2004).The Bill aims to ensure that cooperative governance and oversight functions are improved and that regulatory certainty and negative effects of gambling are drastically reduced. It will focus on enhancing existing gambling activities and no new gambling activities will be introduced. The Bill will ensure that vulnerable groups such as minors and problem gamblers are protected and will be able to access assistance from organisations such as the National Gambling Regulator.It is strategically aligned with the priorities outlined in the NDP with a view to ensure effective governance, social protection, employment creation, recreation and leisure.4. Upcoming events4.1. The Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Ms Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, will lead a delegation to the 17th Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit under the theme  Peace, Sovereignty and Solidarity for Development  to be held in Venezuela from 17 to 18 September 2016.NAM is the largest grouping outside the UN and it allows developing nations to influence global affairs and ensure that their interests are taken into consideration.4.2. President Zuma will lead a delegation to the 71st Session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) to be held at the UN Headquarters in New York from 18 to 22 September 2016.On 1 January 2016, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by world leaders in September 2015 officially came into force.

It will be attended by Heads of State and Government, civil society leaders and others stakeholders who have been instrumental to OGP s success. South Africa assumed the position of Lead Chair of the Partnership at the Mexico Summit in October 2015.Since eight Heads of State and Government partnered with nine civil society leaders to launch the Open Government Partnership on the margins of UNGA in 2011, this dynamic partnership has grown to 70 governments and thousands of civil society organisations across the world, with over 3 000 specific commitments to increase transparency and accountability of governments and to improve public participation.4.6. The Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services, Dr Siyabonga Cwele, will lead the South African delegation to the UN s Broadband Commission meeting that will take place in New York on 18 September 2016.The commission is tasked with looking into strategies of connecting the four billion people who are presently not connected to broadband or fast Internet, in a cost efficient manner. This year s meeting will evaluate and review present strategies and decide on future course of action to enhance the use of broadband for sustainable development.4.7. Transport Month in October 2016 will be hosted under the theme:  Together we move South Africa Forward.  The month-long programme will showcase transport infrastructure projects, promote the use of public transport and advance the country s road safety initiatives.Government is investing in the transport sector which is part of the country s Nine-Point Plan to stimulate development and create jobs. Our public transport investments are part of building and operating an integrated public transport network across the country.The country s transport investment will help grow the economy and address the challenges of unemployment, poverty and inequality. Our investments in transport are positioning the country as an attractive investment destination.5. Cabinet s position on key issues in the environment5.1. Cabinet welcomes the outcomes from the G20 Leaders  Summit, attended by President Jacob Zuma, where interests of the South were advanced.The Summit which was held under the theme:  Towards An Innovative, Invigorated, Interconnected and Inclusive World Economy  discussed the following priority areas: i) Breaking a New Path for Growth, ii) More Effective and Efficient Global Economic and Financial Governance, iii) Robust International Trade and Investment, iv) Inclusive and Interconnected Development, and v) Other issues affecting the World such as Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR).In bolstering innovation as a key driver of growth for individual countries and the global economy, the G20 endorsed the Blueprint on Innovative Growth as a new agenda encompassing policies and measures in and across the areas of innovation, the new industrial revolution and the digital economy.Further, The G20 New Industrial Revolution Action Plan seizes the opportunity that the new industrial revolution presents for industry, particularly manufacturing and related services. This includes support for industrialisation in developing countries, especially those in Africa and Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Also, the launch of the G20 Initiative on Supporting Industrialisation in Africa and LDCs strengthens inclusive growth and development potential through voluntary policy options.In contributing to the building of an open and resilient financial system to support sustainable growth and development, South Africa s proposal that illicit financial flows from trade mispricing be studied by the World Trade Organisation, was accepted. Addressing this challenge holds the potential to unlock finances that could be used by African governments to implement the Sustainable Development Goals and their development programmes.5.2. Cabinet reiterates that it is the responsibility of all South Africans to make a concerted effort to save water and use it wisely, this includes fixing leaking taps and taking care of public infrastructure within communities.The drop in national dam levels has necessitated the imposing of water restrictions in a number of provinces and most recently, the Gauteng Province.We need to work together to support our communities in distress by reporting vandalism and theft of infrastructure to the relevant authorities. Government is mindful of the hardships experienced by our people in the most affected areas and the Inter-Ministerial Task Team on Drought has outlined the intensification of relief interventions to distressed areas.Long and short term interventions are being implemented while monitoring and evaluation of all efforts is on-going. The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, through the National Disaster Management Centre, continues to coordinate the country s drought and water scarcity situation in collaboration with all the sectors and private sector.5.3. Cabinet joins the nation in commending the performance of Team South Africa who are at the Rio 2016 Paralympics in Brazil from 7 to 18 September. These athletes are making our nation proud and continue to build on our stellar reputation of performing well at the Paralympics. Cabinet congratulates the team for winning nine medals: three gold, three silver and three bronze. Cabinet congratulates the following athletes for winning gold medals: swimmer Kevin Paul, Hilton Langenhoven in long jump and Charl du Toit in the 100-metre track.5.4. Cabinet welcomed the release the 2015/16 crime statistics by the South Africa Police Service that reflect an overall trend that crime in the country has decreased.While the progress made by SAPS in bringing down the levels of certain types of crimes is applauded, there remains concern over the increase of violent crime, especially murder.Fighting crime is everyone s responsibility. We all need to work with SAPS to realise our common objective of safer communities, safer cities and a safer country. This will increase collaboration between the different law-enforcement arms to reduce crime levels.5.5. Cabinet reminds taxpayers who submit their tax return manually or by post that the 23 September 2016 deadline for filing their returns for the 2016 tax season is fast approaching.Cabinet wishes to thank taxpayers who have already filed their returns. The revenue collected by SARS aids government in providing services to millions of South Africans who need it the most.5.6. Cabinet recognises the struggles that young people encounter as they try to educate themselves. Government remains committed to ensuring quality and affordable education for all.  Funding made available through the National Student Financial Aid Scheme now stands at R14 582 billion, and helps to ensure that poor hard working students can access education at all 26 public universities and 50 public Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges.According to Statistics South Africa s 2015 General Household Survey:  Educational attainment outcomes continue to improve with improved access to educational facilities and services. Among individuals aged 20 years and older, the percentage who attained Grade 12 as their highest level of education increased from 21,9% in 2002 to 28,0% in 2015. The percentage of these individuals with tertiary qualifications furthermore improved from 9,3% to 14,1% . Cabinet remains committed to a phased realisation of free education for the poor, within fiscal affordability.Our long term vision for higher education will be informed by the Commission of Inquiry into Higher Education Funding and Training, currently sitting and is expected to complete its work by the 30th June 2017. We call on all stakeholders to give the Commission of Inquiry into Higher Education Funding and Training a chance to complete its work. By working together we can find solutions that are both practical and sustainable.5.7. Cabinet is concerned at the resurgence of violent protests in some institutions of higher learning. The destruction of property is a crime that detracts from legitimate issues.The resources destroyed, including a library, as witnessed at University of KwaZulu-Natal, books and infrastructure is unacceptable and destroys the knowledge capital accumulated over time. These are acts of criminality for which the law enforcement agencies must respond firmly.These acts place a strain on already limited resources to provide education to the poor. Cabinet calls on student leadership to join the call for the protection of valuable university infrastructure and resources which is part of the common national heritage of all South Africans.Government has heard the issues raised by students, which is receiving our full attention. We are working together with all parties concerned to find a lasting solution.5.8. Cabinet regrets the tragic loss of lives of those illegal miners who died in the derelict Langlaagte mine. These fatalities highlight the dangers of illicit mining as these unlawful activities put the lives of the community at risk.The Department of Mineral Resource is working with law enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators are brought to book and in particular the main ringleaders who continue to trade in illegal minerals.Cabinet calls on all stakeholders to work together to eradicate illegal mining in the country. The department is working together with mining companies and has closed more than 200 disused mining operations related to illegal mining.5.9. Cabinet congratulates the Department of Basic Education on winning the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) International Literacy award for its Kha Ri Gude Mass Literacy Campaign. The UNESCO International Literacy Prizes reward excellence and innovation in the field of literacy.The Kha Ri Gude Mass Literacy Campaign was introduced to reduce the national rate of illiteracy in South Africa, and has benefitted 4.7-million people in both rural and urban areas. It is offered in the 11 official languages, including braille.5.10. Cabinet congratulates South African soprano Pretty Yende whose rise to international stardom from humble beginnings in Piet Retief are an inspiration to all of us. Amongst other performances, she is set to headline the Italian opera Lucia di Lammermoor at the Op ra Bastille in Paris next month and in December she will play the title role in Rom o et Juliette at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York.5.11. Cabinet congratulates Ms Esther Mahlangu, the world renowned Ndebele artist and recipient of South Africa s National Order of Ikhamanga. Mama Mahlangu and BMW mark the 25th Anniversary of their iconic collaboration at the Frieze Art Fair in London between the 5 and 9 October 2016.5.12. Cabinet joins South Africans in celebrating the life of Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela on her 80th birthday. Popularly known as the  Mother of the Struggle , Mama Winnie is an iconic struggle stalwart and inspiration for women s resilience across the globe.Cabinet sends its condolences to the:5.13. Family and friends of South Africa-born internationally acclaimed opera singer, Mr Johan Botha. Mr Botha will be remembered for his soothing and powerful voice which was heard in various opera theatres and halls across the globe including the Vienna State Opera which made him a Kammers nger, a title that is bestowed on distinguished singers of opera and classical music in Austria and Germany.5.14. Families, friends and colleagues of the Transnet train driver and train assistant who died when a Transnet goods train derailed at the Delvillewood train station following a landslide in Hillcrest west of Durban.5.15.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 28 September 2016,29 Sep 2016,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-28-september-2016-29-sep-2016-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-28-september-2016-29-sep-2016-0000,"1. Implementation of key government programmes1.1. As government we are deeply committed to the upliftment of our people, hence education remains one of our apex priorities. We have demonstrated this through the allocation of resources, where Higher Education and Training was one of the biggest beneficiaries of this year s national budget, receiving an additional 18% for 2016/17.Despite economic difficulties we continue allocating resources as a demonstration of our support to broaden access to Higher Education, and education in general. Government this year provided R1.9-billion of the R2.3-billion shortfall resulting from the subsidisation on the 2016 increase. More than R4.5 billion has been reprioritized in the 2016/17 financial year to make it available to the National Student Financial Aid Scheme to enable poor students to access higher education.1.2. Government is fully aware that an investment in the education of our children will contribute to a higher trajectory of economic growth, which is needed to address the triple challenges of unemployment, poverty and inequality.Government has heard and responded to the pleas of students and will subsidise the fee adjustments for poor working and middle class university students for the 2017 academic year. Students whose parents or guardians can afford to pay for a university education must and should continue to do so, because education is a responsibility of all not only government.1.3. The adjustment takes into account the issue of affordability for students and their parents, as well as the need to ensure that institutions of higher learning remain financially viable. The interim report by the Council on Higher Education proposed an inflation-linked fee adjustment across the board for 2017.1.4. Government accepted the recommendation of a proposed 8% fee adjustment at universities and Technical and Vocational Education and Training colleges, while at the same time providing the gap funding to cover the adjustment for poor and missing middle students.While the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Higher Education and Training Funding completes its work, our university system has to continue functioning, producing skills for the economy, and empowering young South Africans and students from countries around the world, in particular the Southern African Development Community (SADC).1.5. Cabinet appeals to students and student leaders in particular, to raise their concerns appropriately according to the Constitution, which guides all South Africans. Recent violence marred student protests when the country witnessed vandalism, destruction of property, burning of libraries and now even the death of a university worker.1.6. President Jacob Zuma has instructed the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster (JCPS) to deal with the mayhem that is destroying our institutions of higher learning. The President will be meeting with the Ministers from the JCPS Cluster later today. Law-enforcement agencies, who are acting within the confines of the law, will leave no stone unturned in finding those responsible for the criminal activities witnessed.1.7. In welcoming the announcement by the Department of Basic Education that it is all systems go for the 2016 Grade 12 National Senior Certificate examination, we urge all stakeholders to work together to ensure that our institutions of higher learning are in a position to receive the Class of 2016 in order to secure a brighter future for our children. All stakeholders, especially parents and guardians, need to be actively involved in finding lasting solutions to the education funding challenge.The Grade 12 examinations run from 26 October to 29 November 2016. The Minister of Basic Education will announce the outcome of the 2016 Grade 12 exams on 4 January 2017. For the 2016 examinations, there are 677 141 full-time and 150 183 part-time candidates, which is 9 000 more candidates than in 2015, demonstrating government s commitment to ensuring that more of our young people complete their basic education so that they are able to participate in the economy. Cabinet wishes the Class of 2016 well as they embark on the final phase of their school careers.1.8. As the world commemorates World Teachers  Day on 5 October 2016, Cabinet applauds all our teachers and commends them for their dedication and hard work in laying the foundation for our future leaders. The dedication and resilience of our teachers has uplifted our people and continues to propel our children to a brighter future.The Economy1.9. Cabinet is encouraged by the outcomes of the continued engagement between government and captains of industry led by President Zuma through the Presidential CEO Initiative to build confidence in the economy, reignite economic growth and avert a sovereign credit rating downgrade.Progress includes a youth employment programme to place one million youth in paid internships over three years in the private sector, including the establishment of a South African Small and Medium Enterprise Fund with R1,5 billion to invest in small enterprises. In line with government's Nine-Point Plan, work has also been done to analyse eight economic sectors and identify areas for new investment and growth.Going forward business will partner with government through the following projects: establishment of an Agricultural Growth Fund; capacity to support tourism marketing; increasing the numbers of nurses trained; and the revitalisation of declining industrial areas, specifically in the Vaal Triangle.1.10. Progress has also been made in implementing the National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Research, Development and Innovation Strategy (HySA Strategy). Cabinet approved the HySA Strategy in 2007 to create knowledge and enable the development of high-value commercial products in the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell technology sector through beneficiation of the country s platinum group metal resources. This also holds the potential to advance localisation with a view to strengthen black industrialists. This South African innovation involves contributing to international innovation through technology commercialisation while capturing 25% of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell market, which translates to R1.37 billion in 2020.1.11. Cabinet approved the introduction of the new regulation governing the relationship between the employer and the employee in relation to doing business with the State. The gazetted regulations bring into effect the Public Administration Management Act, 2014 (Act 11 of 2014).1.12. The handover of the first 500 houses at the Savanna City Integrated Human Settlements Project, which was led by the Minister of Human Settlements, Ms Lindiwe Sisulu, is part of government s efforts in providing decent housing to needy people and to help restore their dignity by ensuring that they enjoy the right to adequate and quality shelter. A total of 200 houses were handed over to military veterans. When completed in the next five years, the project will have over 18 000 houses, 500 of which will be allocated to military veterans.1.13. The National Internet Governance Forum, and the Southern Africa Development Community Internet Exchange Point have been successfully launched by the Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services, Dr Siyabonga Cwele and African Union (AU) Commissioner Dr Elham Ibrahim.The National Internet Governance Forum (AfIGF) developed a country position, in preparation for the Fifth AfIGF from 16 to 18 October 2016, in eThekwini, KwaZulu-Natal. The AfIGF will lead to lower costs to access the Internet in the region because the Internet traffic will circulate among African countries.These developments underscore the importance that South Africa and the AU attach to meaningful participation in the Internet economy and not just as consumers. These also take us closer to creating a more inclusive digital economy and knowledge society, as envisaged in the National Development Plan (NDP). Government is committed to ensuring that the Internet is universally accessible to all South Africans, which contributes to the creation of an inclusive society.1.14. The Africa Aerospace and Defence Air show and Defence Exhibition was successfully hosted by the Department of Defence, Armscor, SA Aerospace, Maritime and Defence Industry Association, Denel and the Commercial Aviation Association of South Africa. This platform allowed South Africa s defence industries to market their capabilities to the international community, and this year also saw the largest number of exhibitors and national pavilions represented by various countries.2. Cabinet s position on key issues in the environment2.1. Cabinet fully aligns itself with the statement issued by The Presidency on 23 September, on the matter of the Chief Operations Officer (COO) of the SABC. Cabinet respects the ruling of the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) confirming the setting aside of the appointment of Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng as COO of the SABC.Cabinet calls on the SABC Board to abide by the letter and spirit of the SCA ruling. Attempts to subvert the SCA ruling through legally suspect interpretations border on violating the constitutional principle of legality and challenge the constitutionally assigned judicial authority of our courts. The decision to reappoint Mr Motsoeneng in a new position shows disrespect of a rule of law.Cabinet reminded the Board of Section 165 of the Constitution: that an order or decision issued by a court binds all persons to whom and organs of state to which it applies. Cabinet directed the Minister of Communications, Ms Faith Muthambi, to urgently take steps to address this matter with the SABC Board.2.2 Cabinet welcomes the outcomes from South Africa s participation at the 71st United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), which was led by President Zuma. This took place from 20 to 26 September 2016 under the theme  The Sustainable Development Goals: A universal push to transform our world .During this session world leaders adopted the New York Declaration which expresses the political will and commitment to protect the rights of refugees and migrants. The commitments pave the way to negotiations aimed at an international conference and the adoption of a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration in 2018.Our country once again reiterated its call for the strengthening of the institutions of global governance, including the UN, specifically the Security Council and advocated for the urgent reform of these institutions with the aim of correcting the historical injustice against Africa reflected in outdated structures.President Zuma co-hosted with President Francois Hollande, of France the UN High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth on 20 September 2016. The commission was established by the UN Secretary-General and it aims to engage leaders at the highest level to encourage the creation of new employment opportunities in the health sector globally. The Report of the Commission which was adopted by the General Assembly, makes recommendations to Member States, ranging from training needs, continuing education and the need to focus on primary health care. This includes a commitment to train 40 million health workers by 2030.The official handover of the Open Government Partnership (OGP) leader chair position to France was done by President Zuma during the five-year anniversary event on the margins of the UNGA. During South Africa s tenure as chair of the OGP we championed the Open Government Declaration on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which will see OGP member countries incorporating Sustainable Development Goals in their OGP countries  action plans. South Africa also prioritised legislative openness, open data, and broadening civil society participation to include grass root organisation and vulnerable groups within the OGP.3. Key Cabinet decisions3.1. Cabinet was briefed on the assessment by the Academy of Science of South Africa on South Africa s technical readiness to support the shale gas industry, including the recommendations on actions to be implemented by relevant departments. In the transition to low carbon technologies while improving energy security, South Africa is considering shale gas as a potential contributor to the country s future energy mix.The report, which will be released for public consumption, raises a number of issues that require attention in order to bring the country to a full state of readiness. These include: strengthening the regulatory, licensing and monitoring authorities, ensuring that South Africa has the requisite skills; supporting relevant companies to exploit the economic opportunities, putting in place measures that will protect natural resources, and commencing with research. The report will be used as the basis to develop the shale gas research, development and innovation plan.3.2. Progress has been made on Operation Phakisa for Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development. Through Operation Phakisa government seeks to expand growth, with the view to make South Africa a food secure nation at all levels.Since May 2016, extensive consultation sessions were conducted over a four-month period. The actual LAB is taking place over a five-week period from 25 September and 28 October 2016. The primary objective is to ensure the formulation of required and implementable interventions towards greater economic inclusion for the sector. Operation Phakisa: Agriculture and Land Reform seeks to create one million jobs, and plant one million hectares by 2019, as envisioned in the NDP.3.3. Cabinet approved the Capacity-building Strategic Framework for District and Local Municipalities in support of the Agri-parks Programme. The Agri-parks Programme has become the cornerstone of government s priority to Revitalise Agriculture and Agro-processing Value Chain, which is one of the priorities of the Nine-Point Plan. All 44 district municipalities have been included in this programme. This will position Agri-parks to serve as an important mechanism to execute the NDP s proposed rural development strategy due to their potential for supporting small-scale agricultural production and stimulating agro-processing in rural areas.3.4. Cabinet also approved the National Integrated Information Communication Technology (ICT) Policy White Paper, which replaces the separate White Papers on Telecommunications (1996) and Postal Services (1998).This integrated ICT Policy outlines how government will ensure that the sector fulfils its potential to facilitate inclusive social and economic transformation in South Africa. The Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services, Dr Cwele, will convene a separate media briefing to further unpack this policy.3.5. Cabinet approved the submission of the African Telecommunications Union (ATU) Convention of 1999 to Parliament for ratification in terms of Section 231(2) of the Constitution.The ATU is an organ that promotes universal access in Africa and the use of ICTs   such as infrastructure roll-out, radio-frequency spectrum and standard-interoperability   on the continent.South Africa s participation is in line with the NDP and foreign policy objectives of better positioning country globally and strengthening the AU institution in order to fulfil the developmental foreign policy objectives.3.6. Cabinet approved the proposed institutional framework for the establishment of the Multi-Primary Administrator of the Digital Object Architecture (DOA), with the proposed name being MISAVA Agency for Digital Identifier.Implementation of the DOA has the potential to position South Africa by bolstering ICT competitiveness in readiness to participate in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.3.7. Cabinet approved South Africa s revised position to the Southern African Development Community s (SADC) proposal for the development of a memorandum of understanding regarding the establishment of the North South Corridor Management Institution (NSCMI).The SADC Ministers of Transport agreed to establish an NSCMI to address operational inefficiencies and bottlenecks along the North South Corridor. Cabinet also approved for the Minister of Transport to host the North South Corridor Ministers of Transport meeting during 2016/17.3.8. Cabinet was briefed on the development of a new series of commemorative and circulation coins that would represent culture, freedom and democracy, by the South African Mint and its Board of Directors, in conjunction, with the Minister of Finance.Cabinet approved the introduction and designs of the new R10 and R5 Sterling-silver commemorative coins; the new R5 (1/2 oz.) 24-carat gold commemorative coin to the Natura Coin Series for 2017; anda. Designs of the following commemorative coin series:The 2017 Natura Coin Series;The 2017 Sterling-silver Coin Series; andThe 2017 Sterling-silver R2 Crown and 2  c Tickey series.b. The following 2017 Krugerrand coins:The re-issue of the vintage 1967 Krugerrand in 2016; andIntroduction of new Krugerrands to the collection in 2017.4. Bills4.1. Cabinet approved publication of the Social Assistance Amendment Bill of 2016 for public comment. This amends the Social Assistance Act, 2004 (Act 13 of 2004). The Amendment Bill seeks to provide for additional payments and/or benefits linked to social assistance. Amendments would enable the establishment of funeral benefits and additional benefits for orphans and children in child-headed households.5. Upcoming events5.1. Cabinet was briefed on South Africa s preparations and approved the strategy for participation in the upcoming 8th BRICS Summit, being led by the BRICS Inter-Ministerial Committee. The 8th BRICS Summit will be held under the theme  Building Responsive, Inclusive and Collective Solutions (BRICS)  from 15 to 16 October 2016 in Goa, India.Cabinet was also briefed on the status of operationalisation of the New Development Bank Africa Regional Centre. South Africa will continue to support the coming into operation of the BRICS New Development Bank, which includes hosting the Africa Regional Centre in Johannesburg.The established first BRICS financial institutions, such as the New Development Bank and Contingent Reserve Arrangement serve as catalytic institutions to leverage industrialisation and infrastructure programmes in South Africa and the continent.5.2. Cabinet approved the South African negotiating mandate to serve as the basis for engagement at the 28th Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (Montreal MOP 28) to be held from 10 to 14 October 2016, in Kigali, Rwanda. The Montreal Protocol has been very effective in terms of phasing out Ozone Depleting Substances. This links to our Constitution which provides that poverty reduction and socio-economic development should be advanced within the context of sustainable development.5.3. The Third UN Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urbanisation (Habitat III) will be held by the UNGA in Quito, Ecuador from 17 to 20 October 2016. It aims to adopt a New Urban Agenda; an action-oriented document which will set global standards of achievement in sustainable urban development, rethinking the way we build, manage, and live in cities through drawing together cooperation with committed partners, relevant stakeholders, and urban actors at all levels of government as well as the private sector.5.4. The International Conferences on Research Infrastructures (ICRI 2016) will be hosted in Cape Town from 3 to 5 October 2016 by the Department of Science and Technology and the European Commission.The conference aims to highlight the essential role of global research infrastructures in addressing grand challenges and as hubs for innovation; reflecting on needs, development and sustainability of global/regional research infrastructures; and discussing the possibility to move towards an international roadmap.South Africa has demonstrated its science and technology research capability, and is acknowledged as a natural home of some of the world's most significant research infrastructures. The hosting of ICRI 2016 will augment the country's progression to becoming a knowledge-based economy as envisaged in the NDP.5.5. Cabinet welcomes the announcement of the first phase milestone towards switching-off of the analogue transmitter on 28 October 2016 by Communications Minister Faith Muthambi, in the core towns of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) areas in the Northern Cape, in the town of Carnavon within the Kareeberg Local Municipality. Over 86% of households in the SKA areas have been connected and are enjoying digital terrestrial television services in their homes.The migration is also in line with the NDP to create a robust, reliable, secure and affordable ICT infrastructure. It will connect rural and urban, rich and poor ensuring that South African citizens transact and communicate more effectively with the use of technology.5.6. Government will celebrate Social Development Month in October under the theme  Together moving South Africa forward to Socio-Economic Development  and through the Department of Social Development (DSD), will hold country-wide dialogues to better understand the diverse needs of communities.The DSD, together with the National Development Agency (NDA) and the South African Social Security Agency, will inform communities of the various social security programmes available to them and how these can be accessed. Cabinet encourages all sectors to assist government in ensuring that the needs of the most vulnerable in our society are taken care of.1 October 2016 marks the International Day for Older Persons, which will be commemorated as part of the first week of October. This will be dedicated to draw attention to challenging negative stereotypes and misconceptions about older persons and ageing.5.7. The Department of Sports and Recreation and the Association for International Sport for All will host the 6th edition of  The Big Walk  on 2 October 2016 at the Fountains Valley Resort, Pretoria. Cabinet encourages South Africans to embrace an active, healthier lifestyle so as to tackle the high incidence of lifestyle diseases and obesity.5.8. 19 October 2016 marks the 30th anniversary of the plane crash that claimed the life of Mozambican President, Samora Moises Machel and 34 of his country men and women, including pilots and journalists.The people of Mozambique contributed towards the liberation of South Africa and other countries in the subcontinent.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 19 October 2016,20 Oct 2016,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-19-october-2016-20-oct-2016-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-19-october-2016-20-oct-2016-0000,"1. Implementation of Key Government Programmes1.1. Cabinet wishes all students well as they embark on their final year examinations. The Class of 2016 are encouraged to stay focussed as they embark on 2016 National Senior Certificate Examinations which officially starts on 24 October 2016 and ends on 29 November 2016.1.2. Cabinet wishes to reiterate its call for the country to support all efforts to save the 2016 academic programme. These efforts led by government through the Ministerial Task Team working with students, parents, universities and stakeholders are a demonstration of our collective commitment to find solutions to normalise our higher education sector.Cabinet shares the sentiments expressed by students with regards to the challenges they face on high costs of tuition fees, accommodation, textbooks, transport and living expenses.If the academic year is lost, the universities and colleges do not reach a finality this year, almost a million matriculants will not be admitted into higher education, in 2017. The ripple effect is such that all students from first year to final year would be affected and ultimately our economy as no new skilled graduates will enter the job market.Consequently, those who would have graduated as medical doctors, engineers, accountants, teachers and various professions will no longer be in a position to enter the economy.Cabinet fully supports the rights to education that are contained in our Freedom Charter and Constitution, and prioritised in the National Development Plan. We further support the right to access higher education, particularly for the poor.The Freedom Charter says  higher education and technical training shall be opened to all by means of state allowances and scholarships awarded on basis of merit. The Constitution further states  Everyone has the right to further education which the state through reasonable measures must make progressively available and accessible. In appreciation of the magnitude of the challenges in higher education, President Jacob Zuma has further broadened the composition of the Ministerial Task Team with the inclusion of Minsters of Communications, Human Settlements, Finance and Social Development.Government has received several proposals that have been put forward by various constituencies and stakeholders. A technical process is underway to evaluate them and once work is completed, options will be provided to address the current challenges.Government will further take steps to make resources available to all NSFAS qualifying students progressively to cover the full costs of study at universities and TVET colleges over the long term.  Government will also develop mechanisms to address the challenges faced by  missing middle  students who don t qualify under current NFSFAS rules but are unable to afford the full cost of study without some form of assistance. All of these will be phased at a pace and scale that depends on the rate of growth in enrolment and available resources.The Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Higher Education and Training is continuing with its work and will assist government to come up with a long term solution for access to higher education particularly for the poor.The Minister of Finance will table the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement on 26 October 2016 that will set out the broad fiscal framework over the medium term.In the 2016/17 financial year, government has allocated a tremendous amount of resources to higher education, which saw the Department of Higher Education and Training receiving a budget allocation of R49.2 billion.Cabinet believes that it is only through our investment in education as a country that we will make meaningful progress in addressing the triple challenges of unemployment, poverty and inequality. Government has responded to the pleas of students and will subsidise the 2017 fee adjustment of up to 8%, to pay the fee increase through a gap-funding grant on behalf of all poor, working class and so called  missing middle  students, i.e. students with a family household income of up to R600 000 per annum. This means that both NSFAS qualifying students and  missing middle  students will experience a no fee increase, as government will pay the percentage fees adjustment. This subsidy will amount to about R2.5 billion, which covers over 70% of all undergraduate students.All stakeholders must immediately work towards creating conditions and a conducive climate for the academic programme to resume without delay. To ensure the progressive realisation of the right to further education, government will develop a roadmap, working with relevant stakeholders, for the transformation of universities and TVET colleges to create opportunities for access, success, financing and support for students and institutions. Several stakeholders including among others students, banks and business have presented different proposals on how we can finance higher education particularly for the poor. Therefore, Ministerial Task Team will bring all stakeholders under one roof to develop a roadmap that will pave way for a solution.Cabinet welcomes the resumption of classes in many of our universities, and urges all students to return to class. This is a critical period for the academic programme with examinations around the corner. Government believes that the concerns of students can be addressed through dialogue while the academic programme is underway.Cabinet remains concerned at the outbreak of violent student protests on some university campuses around the country. While the right to protest is protected under the Constitution, there is no room for the violence, intimidation and the destruction of property.  All stakeholders must do everything in their power and take every steps necessary to save the academic programme as the consequences facing are will be dire to the economy, students and matriculants. Education is everyone s responsibility, let us all work collectively together to bring about normality to higher education for the future of our children and for the future of our country.1.3. Cabinet welcomed the R3 billion investment by Marriot International that will see the world s largest hotel group complete five new hotels. The announcement demonstrates the investor confidence in the country and positive future prospects of the local economy.1.4. South Africa was named as the best country for debt management and sovereign bond issuance in sub-Saharan Africa by Emerging Markets Newspaper, an affiliate of the IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings. The award comes after the World Bank acknowledged the country s excellence in debt dynamics/composition. These accolades are a testament to the success the country continues to enjoy in global capital markets and the prudent manner in which the economy is managed.1.5. The first Kenyan State Visit by a South African head of state, President Jacob Zuma, since democracy, included a business delegation to the Kenya-South Africa Business Forum, which explored investment and trade opportunities. The following Memorandums of Understanding were signed: police cooperation, biodiversity conservation and management and the Lamu-Port Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor.1.6. The Second Session of the Bi-National Commission between the South Africa and the Republic of Namibia underscored our collective commitment with a range of bilateral, regional and international issues being reviewed. The Memorandum of Understanding on Higher Education has been finalised, including the signing of the Terms of Reference of the Joint Committee of Experts on the Orange River Boundary.1.7. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa s working visit to Vietnam and Singapore was used to unlock future areas of trade and investment, and to attract Singaporean State Owned Enterprises to invest in South Africa through Public Private Partnerships, in line with South Africa's Nine-Point Plan. Commitment was also secured for Singapore to assist South Africa with skills development and to increase the number of training courses for South African students offered under the Singapore Co-operation Programme.1.8. President Jacob Zuma addressed the annual South African Heads of Mission Conference which provided a platform for all our heads of mission to share ideas on issues and priorities which better enables them to continue representing our country. As our representatives abroad they have a responsibility to build friendships and partnerships that will help us achieve our goals from the National Development Plan, that of inclusive growth, jobs and a decent life for our people.1.9. In responding to the needs of communities and businesses, Minister of Water and Sanitation Nomvula Mokonyane will turn the sod for the construction of Phase One of the R18 billion Vaal Gamagara Water Project, this Friday, 21 October 2016. On completion of Phase One, beneficiaries will include 14 livestock farms, 12 mines, solar parks, and the communities of Kathu, Olifantshoek, and Hotazel, benefitting a population of 23 499.1.10. The launch of the R49-million first phase of the revitalised Isithebe Industrial Park in Mandeni, KwaZulu-Natal, forms part of the Revitalisation of Industrial Parks Programme of the Department of Trade and Industry, and has been prioritised for renewal.The aim is to regenerate state-owned industrial parks across the country in order to promote industrialisation and increase their contribution to job creation and the country s economic growth. Industries operating from Isithebe contribute significantly to the economy of the area, providing over 20 000 jobs. During the revitalisation programme 15 small micro medium enterprises were appointed for the project to the value of R6.3 million with 162 people employed.1.11. The announcement, that South Africa will benefit from a new trade deal with the European Union (EU), will see improved access for South African products having preferential market access in the EU. The Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) under the SADC-EU EPA framework replaces the trade provisions of the existing bilateral trade agreement between South Africa and the EU, known as the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement (TDCA). The EPA provides new market access for sugar and ethanol as well as improved market access for wines, flowers, dairy and fruit products.1.12. The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna has increased South Africa s Total Allowable Catch of the Southern Bluefin Tuna allocation from 150 tons to 450 tons for the 2018-2020 fishing seasons. This is essential to South Africa s job creation priorities as it will provide permanent employment in the fisheries sector and will inject much needed export revenue for the country.1.13. The appointment of successful bidders by the Department of Energy for the first Coal-based Independent Power Producer Programme (IPP) is a critical part of government s initiative to secure the country s energy supply. The two successful bidders will add 863.3MW to the energy grid in the next five years.The appointment attracts an investment of more than R40 billion which will be used to unlock infrastructure in the energy sector, stimulate local procurement and create 6 613 jobs during construction and 13 524 through operations.While South Africa s energy build plan incorporates the development of fossil fuel assets, the country is committed to the transition of a low-carbon economy, with priority to clean energy alternatives. Through the Renewable Energy IPP, 6 376 MW of electricity have been procured from 102 Independent Power Producers in six bid rounds. Of this, 2 200 MW of electrical generation capacity from 44 IPP projects has been connected to the national grid.1.14. As Transport Month unfolds a number of key transport infrastructure projects and initiatives are being rolled out to better connect people and places, which is creating new jobs and changing the way South Africans travel.In this regard Cabinet recognises the R24 million investment by the Gauteng Department for Roads and Transport to repair the D904 road, which is also known as the old Evaton Road. The rehabilitation of the existing road will lead to improved travelling time, and will ensure better road safety for motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.1.15. The successful hosting of the Fifth Africa Internet Governance Forum in Durban saw the meeting finalise the continental position, which supports the attainment of the goals of Agenda 2063, ahead of the Internet Governance Forum to be held in Mexico in December 2016. South Africa signed the Multi-Party Administrator Service Agreement with the DONA Foundation.1.16. The interventions by government to combat corruption, malpractices and hold industries accountable has led to an agreement with seven listed construction companies on a programme of initiatives, which will accelerate transformation in the industry. The agreement has a number of elements, including: Financial contribution for development projects; Transformational commitments in the sector; a Framework to settle claims by the public sector; and Integrity Commitments by Chief Executive Officers.Key foundations of the agreement include a R1,4 billion fine imposed by the competition authorities which will be paid by the companies into the National Revenue Fund. A further R1,5 billion will be contributed to a fund to support social investment initiatives targeting previously disadvantaged communities.A transformation commitment will be introduced by each of the seven companies, which may take the form of either an  equity model , where at least 40% of the shares in the company will be sold to black South Africans; or the  partner model  where a company will work with up to three black-owned construction partner companies  to help them generate turnover equal to 25% of its own turnover. This commitment has been valued in excess of R9 billion annual turnover by the end of the agreement period.An integrity commitment will be signed by each CEO that commits to wide-ranging steps to ensure no collusive or corrupt practices in the company, in its dealings with competitors, government or other private sector clients.   The settlement agreement provides for certain formal processes to be finalised within the next few weeks and these are being processed and attended to and an announcement will be made on conclusion of these processes.1.17. South Africans are encouraged to engage with the information being shared through the 2015/16 Annual Report presentations to Parliament. The information demonstrates implementation of Governments Programme of Action, as well as progress on the Medium Term Strategic Framework and implementation of the National Development Plan.1.18. Cabinet also encourages South Africans to share their views on the economy and other issues they would like government to highlight in the upcoming Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTPBS), to be presented by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan on 26 October 2016. Contributions can be sent through Facebook: National Treasury South Africa, Twitter @TreasuryRSA, oral representations and the National Treasury website.2. Key Cabinet decisions2.1. Cabinet approved the broad principles of the National Transport Master Plan 2050 (NATMAP) Synopsis Update Report, which is aligned to the National Development Plan and has the following strategic transport thrusts: long term planning and prioritisation, focusing on safety, reliability and affordability of transport; looking beyond transport as most inefficiencies and ills are the result of poor land use and planning; promoting behavioural change by changing the perception of public transport; and a developmental and socially inclusive planning approach.2.2. Cabinet approved submission of the revised International Telecommunication Regulations (ITRs), Dubai 2012, to Parliament for ratification.The ITRs constitute an international treaty, and forms part of the Administrative Regulations of the International Telecommunications Union. The ITRs are aligned to the National Development Plan, in particular the promotion of economic growth and greater inclusion through the development of a stronger broadband and telecommunications network and lower prices.2.3. Cabinet approved the submission of the World Radio Communication Conference (WRC-15) Final Acts, to Parliament for ratification, in line with Section 231(2) of the Constitution.Key issues adopted at the WRC-15 include universal broadband roll-out, universal broadcasting roll-out, satellite communication services, aircraft services, maritime and the ocean economy programmes, disaster relief and emergency services, as well as future programmes to support economic transformation. WRC-15 outcomes also provides certainty to broadcasting service by protecting Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) spectrum.2.4. Cabinet approved submission of the Final Acts of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Plenipotentiary Conference of Guadalajara 2010, to Parliament for ratification in terms of Section 231(2) of the Constitution.The Plenipotentiary Conference is the top policy-making body of the ITU, which is a specialised agency of the United Nations responsible for managing the global system of electronic communications.The work of the ITU is aligned to the National Development Plan, as it is strongly focused on the development of Economic Infrastructure in the ICT sector.2.5. Cabinet was briefed on the progress made on the establishment and implementation of the Broadband War Room. The August 2016 Cabinet Lekgotla resolved that the Broadband War Room must be established to expedite the implementation of SA Connect, the national broadband policy.As part of the Terms of Reference of the war room, several critical issues were identified that have a direct impact on the successful rollout of affordable, fast, reliable and secure internet. These include; addressing the delays in the allocation of high demand spectrum; broadband connectivity; rollout and funding; addressing ineffective market structures; fast-tracking digital broadcasting migration; development of e-government strategy; rationalisation of ICT State-Owned Entities; and capacitating the Regulator and addressing duplicity in governance of the ICT sector.2.6. Cabinet approved that the Paris Agreement on Climate Change be submitted to Parliament for ratification. The Paris Agreement is a legal instrument that will further guide the process for universal action on climate change. It brings all nations into a common cause of acting collectively to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty. It sets the goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius.The Paris Agreement will enter into force on 4 November 2016, thirty days after the date on which at least 55 Parties to the Convention accounting in total for at least 55 % of the total global greenhouse gas emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification.South Africa's ratification of the Paris Agreement sends a positive signal of our continued commitment to contribute to the global effort to address the challenge of climate change.2.7. Cabinet approved the Draft National Policy on Extension and Advisory Services and its implementation Plan. The Policy aims to set a regulatory framework to enhance the efficiency, productivity, equity, environmental and economic sustainability of the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors. This will ensure that all sectors in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries value chains (from producers to processors) are able to explore opportunities for the advancement of their enterprises and livelihoods.2.8. Cabinet approved the final draft of the refined Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) 2014-2019 for Outcome 2  A long and Healthy Life for All South Africans . This serves as the building block to implement Chapter 10 of the National Development Plan 2030.The MTSF 2014-2019 was refined to incorporate latest evidence of the health sectors actual performance against the targets in the MTSF 2014-2019; adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 by South Arica, and to reduce process indicators.2.9. Following Cabinet approval, the Minister in the Presidency responsible for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Jeff Radebe will release the findings of the 2015 Management Performance Assessment Tool (MPAT). The report provides consolidated learning of the MPAT assessments and case studies analysis from 2011 until 2015.MPAT has been implemented to facilitate reforms in managerial practices in government departments. This contributes to the National Development Plan which states that between now and 2030 South Africa needs to have established a state that is more capable, more professional and more responsive to the needs of its citizens.The 2015 results show that MPAT has succeeded in facilitating incremental improvements in management practices; however, it varies across national departments and provinces. There are pockets of excellence with regard to management practices throughout government but weak managerial leadership practices remain a major challenge and contribute to administrative failures.Cabinet supports a more integrated and holistic approach to support improvements, which will be led by the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation.3. Bills3.1. Cabinet approved that the Prevention and Combating of Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill be published for public comment. The Bill seeks to create the offences of hate crimes and hate speech and to put in place measures to prevent and combat these offences. The aim is to address the increasing number of racial incidents and to further address other types of criminal conduct motivated by bias, prejudice or intolerance, in the form of hate crimes and hate speech, which have occurred in the recent past.This is aligned to the National Development Plan which highlights the need for sustained campaigns against racism, sexism, homophobia and xenophobia and that all people are and feel safe.4. Upcoming events4.1. Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October, represents a national effort by public and private health care to raise awareness of the disease. Early detection of the condition can lead to effective treatment. All women and men should conduct regular self-examination and undergo screening through their nearest health care facility.4.2. The Department of Health will host the 40th World Hospital Congress of the International Hospital Federation (IHF) under the theme, ""Addressing the Challenge of Patient - centered Care and Safety , in Durban from 31 October to 3 November 2016.The Congress provides a unique global forum which facilitates multidisciplinary exchange of knowledge, expertise and experiences in health sector management and service delivery.5. Cabinet s position on key issues in the environment5.1. Cabinet has affirmed its support for Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan who under Section 35 of the Constitution is innocent until proven otherwise by a court of law.Cabinet remains confident in the country s criminal justice system and the fair and just judicial processes which have defined our democratic era. These processes must be allowed to take their course.5.2. The outcomes from the 8th BRICS Summit, which was held from 15 to 16 October 2016 under the theme  Building Responsive, Inclusive and Collective Solutions (BRICS)  in Goa, India, saw BRICS leaders hold interactive roundtable discussions on strengthening intra-BRICS cooperation and reflecting on global issues such as international conflicts, the fight against terrorism, and reform of the global system of governance, notably the democratisation of the United Nations and the Bretton Woods Institutions.The adoption of the Goa Declaration and Action Plan, highlighted the strong foundation that BRICS has made in terms of establishing institutional mechanisms for tangible cooperation. The possibility of setting up an independent BRICS Rating Agency based on market-oriented principles, in order to further strengthen the global governance architecture, was also welcomed.During the visit to Goa, the Cipla Pharmaceuticals Company and the Dube Industrial Development authorities signed an agreement to establish a bio-logics facility. This R1.3 billion investment will result in the first plant on the African continent, producing affordable anti-cancer drugs based on bio-technology processes.5.3. Cabinet pays tribute to the people of Mozambique for their solidarity and sacrifice in our struggle for freedom. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and the Minister of Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa, attended the commemoration of the 30th anniversary service of the late Samora Machel, the founding father and President of Mozambique, who died under suspicious circumstances in Mbuzini. In honouring the memory of great African leaders like Samora Machel, Julius Nyerere, Oliver Tambo and Nelson Mandela, we remember that leadership to them meant dedicated service to Africa to advance the interests of the people of Africa.We are building on our common history and enjoy strong diplomatic and economic relations to boost economic growth, create employment and reduce inequality. The creation of the Maputo Development Corridor, which links the port of Maputo with our country s industrial heartland, is a vital part of our effort to promote trade and investment and foster regional integration.5.4. Cabinet extends its good wishes to Advocate Busisiwe Joyce Mkhwebane on her appointment as Public Protector of the Republic of South Africa for a period of seven years with effect from 15 October 2016. Cabinet is confident that Advocate Mkhwebane will serve the nation well and will continue to act in the best interest of all South Africans.5.5. Cabinet expresses its gratitude to Advocate Thuli Madonsela for serving the country and placing the office of the Public Protector uppermost in the minds of citizens.5.6. Cabinet joins South Africa's media in commemorating the anniversary of Media Freedom Day known as ""Black Wednesday"" and commends the media industry for the role they have played in strengthening the country's democracy. On 19 October 1977, the apartheid regime ordered The World and Weekend World to cease publication and sparked the mass detention and banning of journalists.Our democratic Constitution explicitly protects our hard fought media freedoms that are recognised as playing a critical role in the advancement of national unity and equality for all.As we reflect on the progress South Africa has made in entrenching media freedom, Cabinet congratulates SANEF on its 20th anniversary which will be celebrated next week.5.7. Cabinet extends the hand of solidarity to the people of Nigeria and to the families of the girls who remain in captivity, following the news that 21 of the 2019 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram militants have been freed. Cabinet calls on the international community to renew its efforts in assisting the Nigerian authorities to secure the girls' release; in particular for all African countries and the African Union to lend support to assisting Nigeria in finding the missing children.5.8.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 1 and 2 November 2016,3 Nov 2016,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-1-and-2-november-2016-3-nov-2016-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-1-and-2-november-2016-3-nov-2016-0000,"1. Implementation of Key Government Programmes1.1.  Cabinet congratulates Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and the team at National Treasury for delivering a balanced and well thought-out budget. The Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) provides an opportunity for civil society, labour and business to work together with government to achieve the economic objectives of our country.Cabinet supports the initiatives announced in the MTBPS to guide the economy through these difficult economic times, achieve inclusive economic growth and efficiently use state resources.1.2. Cabinet thanks the more than 4, 5 million taxpayers who submitted their tax returns during the 2016 Tax Season and reminds all non-provisional taxpayers who still have to submit a tax return to do so as the deadline for submission on 25 November 2016 is fast approaching.Patriotic taxpayers are helping to improve the lives of millions of South Africans by partnering with government as it rolls out much needed services and social support across the communities.Cabinet calls on South Africans to join our efforts in growing the economy by creating new jobs, and adopting a culture of saving. Working together we can ensure that we boost economic growth.Cabinet supports calls for a quick and effective investigation into the alleged hostage situation at the South African Revenue Service. Incidents such as these have a negative impact on public confidence in our law enforcement authorities and need to be quickly addressed.1.3. Funding higher education remains a priority for government and the additional R17 billion allocated to universities over the next three years will help to further ease the burden on financially needy poor and missing middle students. This funding will also ensure that more students are able to access higher education as R9.2 billion of this funding will be allocated to NSFAS.This funding is welcomed, however the immediate priority now is to resume learning. Cabinet calls on South Africans to support all efforts to save the 2016 academic programme.  Now is the time to end all protests, return to class and complete the academic year without further delays. Government believes that dialogue to address the demands of students can take place while the academic programme is underway. We reaffirm the right to protest but this must be done within the confines of the law and in a manner that does not infringe on the rights of others.Government s advances in making higher education accessible are borne out by the Statistics South Africa Financial Statistics of Higher Education Institutions 2015 report. It shows that student enrolment in Higher Education grew by 32.5 per cent from 2006 to 2015. Further, grants by national government to Higher Education increased by 144 per cent over a ten year period from 2006 to 2015. Government grants and tuition fees account for the bulk of university income, with government spending accounting for 43 per cent of university income and tuition fees accounting for 34 per cent. These findings demonstrate government s commitment to education and reaffirms our call for those who can afford to pay their fair share, and reveals that tuition fees remain an important part of overall funding.Progress has also been made by the Ministerial Task Team appointment by the Minister of Higher Education and Training, Blade Nzimande, to develop a support and funding model for Poor and  Missing Middle  students. A blueprint entitled the Ikusasa Student Financial Aid Programme (ISFAP), underwent an engagement process, which saw various inputs incorporated, and agreement obtained across all key stakeholders for the future governance structure of ISFAP.The Ikusasa Student Financial Aid Programme makes various recommendations which are currently under consideration for implementation. The proposed model and recommendations contained in the report, will go a long way in not only addressing the funding problems faced by poor and  missing middle  students, but also in addressing amongst other challenges which South Africa faces, including:Reducing the high dropout rates of poor and working class students in the higher education and training sector,Improving the employability of the funded graduates,Improving the skills profile of the country,Improving the partnership between government, the private sector and higher education institutions in supporting poor and  missing middle  students.The ISFAP blueprint provides poor and  missing middle  students financial assistance to cover the full cost of study. While recommending a fully subsidized education to the poor in the form of bursaries and grants, it also proposes progressively reducing bursaries and grants to the  missing middle  students as household income increases and sketches scenarios of how this can be achieved by mobilising funds from both the public and private sectors.1.4. The launch of the Tourism Enterprise Development Incubator, in Pilanesberg in the North West by the Minister of Tourism Derek Hanekom, will create a conduit for economic inclusion through viable tourism businesses. This enhances the tourism sector s contribution to building an inclusive economy.The pilot incubator will target 50 SMMEs in the Bojanala District and will support them for three years to become sustainable. The Tourism Enterprise Development Incubator provides business support to tourism enterprises.1.5. The launch of Ngwaabe Integrated Energy Centre on 4 November 2016 by the Department of Energy, in collaboration with strategic partners is part of a programme to establish Integrated Energy Centres in poverty nodal areas. This one-stop energy shop provides access to safe and affordable energy resources for poor households.In addition, it provides information on safe, efficient and environmentally sustainable use of energy sources. It also promotes the SMME sector and grows job opportunities through energy related businesses.1.6. The Windaba Conference and Exhibition which is taking place from 2 to 4 November 2016 at the Cape Town International Convention Centre under the theme  Towards 100% renewables  also boosts government s renewable energy initiatives.It brings together stakeholders involved in the wind energy value chain on the African continent and in South Africa in particular. In addition, the 11th Annual 2016 Southern African Energy Efficiency Convention from 8 to 9 November 2016 at Emperors Palace in Johannesburg will focus on a range of energy-related fields. Areas that will be covered include energy engineering, efficiency improvement, facilities and building management, renewable and alternative energy, co-generation, power generation, energy services and sustainability.1.7. Today, President Jacob Zuma will co-chair the Inaugural Session of the Zimbabwe-South Africa Bi National Commission with President Robert Mugabe. The main objective is to deepen bilateral relations and cooperation between the two countries and to strengthen and develop the potential that exists for closer ties in the fields of trade, investment, mining, water, energy, infrastructure development, transport, and ICT, among others.To date, the two countries have signed more than 38 Memoranda of Understanding and Agreements, which cover a broad range of areas, which include among others, trade and investment, immigration and consular matters, defence, agriculture, the environment, energy, health, as well as arts and culture.1.8. The successful hosting of the Annual Diplomatic Fair by the Department of International Relations and Cooperation and Proudly South Africa at the Union Buildings on 29 October 2016 in Pretoria serves as a key platform to educate the general public about diplomacy and South Africa s foreign policy objectives.This event brought together embassies, high commissions and international organisations accredited to South Africa to showcase and promote cultural diplomacy through creative expressions such as arts, music and cuisine from around the world. Over 60 diplomatic missions and several private businesses showcased their products and opportunities this year.2. Key Cabinet decisions2.1. The Special Cabinet of 1 November 2016, received progress reports on the work of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on State Owned Companies (SOC) Reform, chaired by Deputy President, Cyril Ramaphosa.This emanates from the implementation of Cabinet endorsed recommendations from the 2010 Presidential Review Commission of SOCs. Cabinet reaffirmed the phased approach to implementation of these recommendations.Cabinet reiterates that all state owned entities must be efficient, and financially viable.A suite of decisions was taken to pursue the central policy objective of strengthening SOCs to enable them to meet their developmental objectives.Cabinet endorsed a Private Sector Participation framework for infrastructure delivery which will guide collaboration between SOCs and the private sector.Cabinet adopted the guideline for the remuneration and incentive standards for directors of SOEs.Cabinet endorsed the broad thrust of a guide for the appointment of boards and executive officers, for which, the Department of Public Service and Administration will undertake a consultation process with provinces and municipalities, before Cabinet approval.The first draft of a new government shareholder policy was recommended for further consultation. This will culminate in the promulgation of an over-arching SOC legislation.National Treasury developed a proposal for determining and costing developmental mandates of state enterprises, the introduction of this approach will help streamline commercial and non-commercial activities of SOCs.These better position the SOCs to contribute towards the implementation of the National Development Plan: building infrastructure, growing the economy, expanding industry, helping develop high-end skills, creating jobs and advancing other transformation objectives.2.2. Cabinet approved that the Integrated Energy Plan (IEP) be published for public discussion to afford stakeholders and interested parties to engage with it. The IEP is anchored in the National Energy Act, 2008 (Act No. 34 of 2008). It seeks to guide future energy infrastructure investments and policy development which will shape the future energy landscape of South Africa.Integrated energy planning is required to ensure that current and future energy service needs can be met in the most efficient and socially beneficial manner, while controlling economic costs, serving national imperatives such as poverty alleviation and job creation and minimising adverse impacts on the environment.The IEP provides a long-term vision of how South Africa can use energy optimally as a mechanism to remain competitive, which inherently requires a shift in how various energy resources are utilised.2.3. Cabinet amended its decision of 10 June 2015 to designate the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation as the implementing Agent for the Nuclear New Build Programme. This decision, at the time, allowed Eskom to focus on the Medupi, Kusile and Ingula projects and the energy challenges the country was experiencing.Cabinet designated Eskom as the Owner Operator and Procurer for Nuclear Power Plants in accordance with the Nuclear Energy Policy of 2008. Eskom has more than 30 years of safe operation of the Koeberg Nuclear Power Plant, which is also the only Nuclear Power Plant in Africa, and has been developing the Environmental Impact Assessment and nuclear Site Safety Reports for possible nuclear power plants since 2007.Cabinet also approved designating the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation as the Owner Operator and Procurer for Nuclear Fuel Cycle and Multi-Purpose Reactor.The Department of Energy will continue to act on its mandate as the policy setting and coordinating department of the Nuclear Build Programme.2.4. Cabinet was briefed on the progress regarding the update of the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) and approved that public consultation be undertaken on the base case and assumptions.Since the IRP 2010-30 there has been a number of developments affecting the energy sector. The IRP update process balances a number of objectives to ensure security of supply so as to minimise cost of electricity, to promote job creation and localisation, to minimise negative environmental impacts, minimise water use and to diversify supply sources.The first milestone which is the compilation of assumptions to be used in the IRP has been completed, pending public consultation. The second milestone on the development of the base case which is a least cost plan has been completed. The third milestone which is a scenario analysis is underway. And the fourth milestone, is policy adjustment.2.5. Cabinet received an update on developments in the negotiating position at the World Trade Organisation and agreed on the need for a development focus in the post-Nairobi work programme and in preparation for Eleventh Ministerial Conference of the WTO (MC11) to be held in Argentina in December 2017.This is in line with the National Development Plan s objectives of developing appropriate policy responses in a dynamic global environment.2.6. Cabinet was briefed on the resolutions taken by the President s Coordinating Council meeting held on 11 March 2016. This is a statutory body established in terms of the Intergovernmental Relations Framework Act, 2005 (Act No13 of 2005), which brings together the three spheres of government on matters of common interest and national importance with a view to strengthening co-operative governance.Issues which were discussed included: Implementation of the Back to Basics Programme, progress report on the establishment of newly re-determined municipalities; government s response to drought and water shortages; and review of South African Immigration Regulations, 2014.2.7. Cabinet approved publication of the draft White Paper on Fire Services, public comments. It outlines key policy proposals and options that form the basis for a reviewed fire services legislation that will replace the outdated Fire Brigades Services Act, 1987 (Act No. 99 of 1987).This resonates with the Back to Basic approach, by placing an obligation on fire services to constantly engage with communities they serve to work together to reduce fire risks and ensure adequate response strategies and systems to respond to fires and other related incidents rapidly and effectively.The White Paper repositions the fire services from response orientated fire services towards a fire risk reduction based approach. This contributes to effective integrated disaster management and fire services, by placing fire safety and prevention, particularly community-based fire risk reduction, at the centre of fire services delivery which will significantly contribute to the creation of safer communities as highlighted in the National Development Plan.3. Bills3.1. Cabinet approved the introduction of the Road Accident Fund Amendment Bill, 2016 in Parliament. The Bill amends the Road Accident Fund Act, 1996 (Act No 56 of 1996) which provides for the payment of compensation for loss or damage wrongfully caused by the driving of motor vehicles.The Bill is aligned with the National Development Plan and with Outcome 13 which provides for an inclusive and responsive social protection system by ensuring efficient service delivery and early medical intervention to assist with recovery and return to work, and no-fault cover to ease the financial burden on those who are disadvantaged.4. Upcoming events4.1. Members of the Executive across the three spheres of government will interact with South Africans countrywide during the National Imbizo Focus Week between 7 and 11 November 2016, under the theme  Together we move South Africa forward:  Our future   make it work . Cabinet encourages all South Africans to actively participate in these events and engage with political principals, as an informed and active citizenry is a critical to deliver on Vision 2030, of the National Development Plan (NDP). The Imbizo Focus Week programme will be available on www.gov.za.4.2. South Africa marks National Disability Rights Awareness Month under the theme:  Persons with disabilities - equal participants in shaping a sustainable future  from 3 November and concludes with International Day of Persons with Disabilities, on 3 December 2016. The month long programme will be used to mobilise society and decision-makers to take responsibility for ensuring that persons with disabilities have equitable access. Programmes will also raise awareness on the participation of persons with disabilities in building sustainable and cohesive communities. Information on the rights of persons with disabilities will also be made accessible to support their empowerment.Cabinet calls on all South Africans to advance the rights and quality of life of people with disabilities in line with our commitment in the National Development Plan to increase access to services, particularly in quality education and employment for people with disabilities.4.3. Cabinet calls on all South Africans to support the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children campaign. South Africa adopted the campaign in 1998 as one of the intervention strategies towards creating a society free of violence.16 Days is an international campaign which takes place every year from 25 November to 10 December. The campaign aims to raise awareness amongst South Africans about the negative impact of violence against women and children.  It also calls on every person to take a stand against violence against women and children.4.4. Cabinet approved South Africa s negotiating mandate to serve as the basis for engagement at the 22nd Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP22), and the 12th Session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP12), to be held from 7 to 18 November 2016 in Bab Ighli, Marrakech, Morocco.The negotiating position is in line with the National Development Plan which promotes environmental sustainability as well as the Constitution, which states that the environment should be preserved for present and future generations.5.  Cabinet s position on key issues in the environment5.1. The decision by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to withdraw fraud charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan brings the matter to finality and allows the country to direct all efforts to advance the economy, build investor confidence and avert an international credit rating downgrade.5.2. Cabinet was briefed on the impact of the drought on water supplies in South Africa with a particular focus on Gauteng which is supplied with water from the Integrated Vaal River system.South Africa received the lowest rainfall since 1904 (114 years) with extremely high temperatures experienced in October and November of 2015.This has severely impacted on our water supplies with national average dam levels decreasing to 48.4% compared with the same time last year when levels were at 66.6%. We are still very much in a neutral situation and it is very likely that we can expect an extended period of recovery.It could take at least two to three years to see any significant recovery in dam capacity and this could even extend to five years. We are therefore still in for a long road to recovery.With regard to the Integrated Vaal River System consisting of 14 dams which supplies water to Gauteng, the system is currently at 49.1% compared with 67.9% at the same time last year.This system also provides water to the bulk of the ESKOM coal fired power stations, SASOL, irrigation users and mines and industries in Eastern Mpumalanga, North West, Free State and Northern Cape, thus supporting approximately 45% of the country's economy and 35% of the population. 80% of the water from the Vaal system is used by domestic consumers. This is the third week that the system is below 50% during this drought. The Vaal Dam is now at 26.4%, Katse dam is at 38.4%, Sterkfontein Dam at 91.5% and Grootdraai Dam is at 66.3%. Restrictions of 15% for urban use and 20% for irrigation use have been imposed as published in the Government gazette on 12 August. These restrictions are mandatory.A Technical Task Team has been established to monitor the implementation of the restrictions. Rand Water is the main supplier of potable water into Gauteng and the target is to reduce the supply from Rand Water by 687 million litres per day.All Municipalities within the supply are have been given specific targets to meet in respect of reducing their water consumption. The initial approach has been an incremental one with a gradual reduction in supplies, starting at 5% and gradually increasing to 15% by throttling the main valves. From 3 October we shifted to a volume based restriction.It is important that all consumers comply with the restrictions to make sure that we can stretch our available water supplies. The province of Gauteng is setting up a Joint Operations Centre (JOC) to monitor and ensure compliance. All Municipalities have also been directed to establish operation centres with immediate effect and to ensure that communication with consumers is improved.The Vaal dam will be kept at 25% and this will be achieved by transferring water from Sterkfontein dam. This is necessary to protect the integrity of intakes for ESKOM, Rand Water and SASOL. Releases will commence on 7 November and continue for a minimum of 54 days to 30 December.The minimum release planned at this stage is 190 million cubic metres of water which will drop the Sterkfontein dam by approximately 7%. The staggered release is to minimise any danger to communities downstream of Sterkfontein and to minimise damage to river banks which have been dry for a considerable period of time.Cabinet calls on South Africans to use water efficiently and conserve it. All water users must adhere to water restrictions where they are being implemented, and continue to save water, working with municipalities. Government is doing all it can to mitigate against the current conditions and is working with all stakeholders in drought affected areas.5.3. The African Union Commission Chairperson, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma hosted the engagement between African Editors and Press Officers from all 54 African Union member States, under the theme  Deepening Africa s Narrative and Capacities to Deliver Agenda 2063 . Agenda 2063 calls for all segments of the African society and the African Diaspora to work together to build a prosperous and united Africa based on shared values and a common destiny.Participants reflected on African Union milestones over the past four years, gained a better understanding of Agenda 2063 and how African media can be at the forefront of popularising and driving it. The role of accurate reporting in shaping an African narrative and advocating for media ownership amongst Africans was also discussed.5.4. Cabinet joins in the commemoration of the life and times of OR Tambo as a demonstration of the respect and appreciation for the role he played in driving the agenda of a non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and prosperous South Africa.The department of Arts and Culture has already commenced with the planning of the Centenary Celebration of OR Tambo in 2017.Cabinet congratulated the following:5.5. Mamelodi Sundowns who are the new African football champions after winning the Confederation of African Football Champions League. Cabinet thanks all the supporters and all South Africans for rallying behind the team, which did South Africa proud.

The Commission on Restitution of Land Rights has, during the period 1 April 2016 to 31 October 2016 paid-out close to a billion rand in compensation to land claimants who were dispossessed of their rights in land.1.11.  The findings of the recent Institute of Race Relations report:  Life in South Africa: Reasons for Hope  shows that life in South Africa is better today compared to 20 years ago.In 2015 real per capita GDP was 33 per cent higher than in 1994; disposable income growth per capita increased from R23,686 in 1994 to R33,660 in 2015 (an increase of 42 per cent), the total number of people with jobs doubled from 7.9-million in 1994 to 15.6-million in 2015; access to formal housing increased by 131.3 per cent from 1996 to 2016; university enrolment rates increased by 281.4 per cent from 211,756 in 1985 to 807,663 in 2014; the number of new HIV infections dropped from 646,806 in 1999 to 321,497 in 2015; there has been a 62.5 per cent increase in healthcare professionals in the public sector between 2000 to 2015; and the murder rate has fallen by 49.3 per cent since 1994.These highlight that while there are challenges, life for South Africans has improved over the past two decades. Cabinet encourages all sectors of society to continue to build on the advances of our nation since the dawn of democracy. There remain more positives for the country than there are negatives.Implementation of Governments Programme of Action:1.12. Government s fifth National Imbizo Focus Week which was held from 7 to 13 November 2016 under the theme  Together we move South Africa forward: Our future   make it work  saw South Africans actively engaging with government. This period of intense interaction further contributes to an informed and active citizenry; a critical element in delivering the National Development Plan (NDP) Vision 2030.President Jacob Zuma initiated the week during an Imbizo at Marhulana Primary School in Tembisa, Gauteng where a fully equipped computer laboratory was handed over.1.13. The opening of the Swartkopfontein road and bridge between South Africa and Botswana unlocks a new chapter in linking the South African border posts at Swartkopfontein to Botswana s border post at Ramotswa. The upgraded road and bridge infrastructure, at an investment of R78.5 million resulted in 51 full time jobs being created over the 23-month contract period, with labour sourced from both countries.1.14. The Revitalisation of Industrial Parks Programme, under the Minister of Trade and Industry, Rob Davies is creating jobs in and around townships and rural communities. The programme was implemented in response to a call by President Jacob Zuma to work towards full scale industrialisation and inclusive growth amongst others. The Department of Trade and Industry has so far invested R22.5m in the revitalisation of the Komani Industrial Park. During the 1st phase of the revitalisation programme, seven small micro medium enterprises were appointed as sub-contractors to the value of R5, 3million. Seventy-one local labourers were employed, of which 63 per cent were youth.The Black Industrialist programme, with an objective to increase role-players in the manufacturing sector, has to date supported 22 Black Industrialists and 1500 jobs have been created. R1.5 billion has been injected to support these industrialists.1.15. The Global Entrepreneurship Week was launched in Johannesburg last Friday by Deputy President, Cyril Ramaphosa, supported by Minister Lindiwe Zulu. It is taking place from 14 to 20 November 2016, and is the largest gathering of innovators and entrepreneurs who launch start-ups by bringing ideas to life, driving economic growth and stimulating socio-economic development. Cabinet recognises business and social partners in bringing GEW to South Africa, namely the Gauteng Provincial Government, City of Johannesburg, Hollard, Microsoft, IDC, SABS, SAB, SEA Africa, the Global Entrepreneurship Network and the Kauffman Foundation. Over 80 partner events will take place during this period. The GEW is a lead-up to the Global Entrepreneurship Congress (GEC) which will be hosted for the first time on the African continent in Johannesburg during March 2017, where over 5 000 delegates from 160 countries are expected to attend.1.16. Minister Nomvula Mokonyane on 14 November 2016 launched the Drakenstein Waste Water Treatment Plant and handed it over to the Drakenstein Municipality in the Western Cape. The project value is approximately R 171 000 000 and has benefited the local authority and community by providing experience and training in construction; recruitment of local people; and sourcing of materials from local suppliers and manufacturers.The provision of a basic water service to the community contributes to the improvement of the quality of water in the Berg River and alleviates the negative impact of poor quality irrigation water.1.17. Water and sanitation are at the very core of sustainable development. The Department of Water and Sanitation is embarking on a Sanitation Campaign which will culminate with World Toilet Day on 19 November 2016, which is used to create awareness, to educate and apply efforts to ensure that everyone has access to decent sanitation services.South Africa has committed itself to accelerate the provision of water and sanitation services, and as such restore the dignity particularly of those people from previously disadvantaged communities. The Bucket Eradication Programme is aimed at addressing the legacy of bucket toilets as a form of sanitation system in four provinces, namely the Eastern Cape, Free State, North West and the Northern Cape. A total of 25 264 buckets have been eradicated to date and a total of 26 985 buckets remain to be completed from a baseline of 52 249.1.18. The graduation of young people from the four-year National Rural Youth Corps (NARYSEC) programme on 17 November 2016 complements government's job creation programmes and initiatives. The programme, which was launched in 2010, is a youth skills development and employment programme that helps to transform young people in the rural areas from being job seekers to creators of jobs.1.19. The Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) Municipal Summit is underway from 15 to 17 November 2016 under the theme  See, Feel and Experience Public Employment Programmes , at St George Conference Centre in Gauteng. EPWP is a key government initiative, which contributes to decent work and sustainable livelihoods, education, health, rural development, food security and land reform, including the fight against crime and corruption.The summit focuses on the practical components of the programme by providing an opportunity to share experiences and best practices. This enhances government efforts of providing employment opportunities and skills acquisition through training which in turn revitalises poor communities.More than 7 million work opportunities have been created through EPWP from 2004 to 2016. This indicates successful implementation of the programme by all spheres of government, municipalities and civil society. EPWP Phase 3 is in its third year of implementation   and has seen the introduction of universal principles which govern the implementation of the programme and its main task is to promote community involvement where EPWP projects are implemented. This also allows transparency in terms of recruitment.1.20. The successful migration from analogue to digital broadcasting for residents within the Square Kilometre Array area in the Northern Cape, means that these residents are among the first to experience the full range of benefits of improved sound and picture quality associated with digital television.The announcement by Minister Muthambi to complete the process of migrating to the broadcasting digital system by December 2018 in a provincial phased approach is underway, having already started in the Northern Cape and Limpopo. Registrations are open in the Free State, Mpumalanga and Limpopo. Registrations will also open in the North West, Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape and Gauteng at a later stage.1.21. The analogue switch off forms part of the country s Broadcasting Digital Migration process in the country. Poor households who qualify for the government subsidy are urged to register for free STBs at their local Post Office branches.1.22. Cabinet was also briefed on the plan to exhume the remains of political activists who were hanged during apartheid. There were at least 130 political prisoners who were hanged for politically-related offences between 1960 and 1990, after which the death penalty was suspended. These patriots will be properly buried in their places of origin.This process follows the public launch of the Gallows Exhumation Project on 23 March 2016 at the Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Centre, to commence with the exhumation of the remains of 83 political activists over a period of six months before the end of 2016/17.1.23. Cabinet welcomed the successful conclusion of the 3rd Session of the Bi-National Commission between Botswana and South Africa led by President Jacob Zuma and his counterpart President Seretse Khama Ian Khama to further deepen economic cooperation between the two countries.Fast tracking work on the Lesotho Highlands Water Transfer Project, implementation of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Industrialisation Strategy and Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan to create regional value chains and manufacturing capacities, and cooperation in border management to combat cross-border crimes such as rhino and elephant poaching, were among the areas explored.South Africa reaffirmed its support for the SADC candidate for the post of the AU Commission Chairperson, Honourable Dr. Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi, the Minister of International Affairs and Cooperation of the Republic of Botswana.1.24. President Jacob Zuma concluded a successful Working Visit to Addis Ababa, in the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia where he attended the African Union (AU) High Level Committee on Libya meeting to review and discuss the peace and security situation in Libya. The Committee discussed and agreed on a number of issues that would help find a lasting solution to challenges facing the people of Libya. As members of the African Union we want to see peace and stability in Libya and the committee agreed that as Africa we need to extensively persuade all involved parties in Libya to find an African solution to the problems facing the country.President Zuma also participated in the Second Extraordinary Summit of the Volunteering Nations of the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises (ACIRC). The aim of this Summit was to discuss the status of the ACIRC Force following the conduct of the UTULIVU AFRICA I and II Command Post Exercises (CPX) and the verification of the pledged capabilities from May 2014 to April 2015. Volunteering countries to the ACIRC, which include South Africa, resolved to take a lead in bringing about African solutions for African challenges without the intervention of external forces.2. Upcoming events2.1. The 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children takes place annually from 25 November (International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women) to 10 December (International Human Rights Day). Other key commemorative days during this period include World Aids Day on 1 December and the International Day for People with Disabilities on 3 December.The 2016 theme for the 16 Days of Activism is  Count me in: together moving a non-violent South Africa forward  and is being sustained through a year-long approach in working continuously with communities.President Jacob Zuma will on 25 November 2016 launch the National Dialogues which will see District Municipalities convene dialogues throughout the year. The dialogues will incorporate skills development and empowerment for communities, especially for women, as well as service delivery improvement in terms of access to justice and counselling and health services. All South Africans have a duty to be active participants in the fight against violence against women and child abuse.2.2. International Relations and Cooperation Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane and the Minister of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation, Mr Sergey Donskoy, will co-chair the 14th Session of the Joint Intergovernmental Committee on Trade and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) between South Africa and the Russia on Friday, 18 November 2016, in Pretoria.This session is expected to agree on specific plans of action to expedite implementation of existing commitments within all the sectors of ITEC, including trade, investment and banking; mineral resources; energy; agriculture, forestry and fisheries; transport; science, technology and space; water resources; and education and justice.2.3. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will lead a delegation of ministers and non-governmental stakeholders on 19 November 2016 to the Youth Career Development Expo at the Nkowankowa Stadium in the Greater Tzaneen Local Municipality, Limpopo.The expo will provide career guidance and information on further education and training opportunities to learners who are in Grades 10 to 12, to unemployed youth, and to youth who have dropped out from high school. The Youth Career Development Expo is part of government s work to advance young people, particularly their participation in the economy, so that they can take their rightful place in our society.2.4. Following the Local Government Elections, public participation in the governance of communities remains critical to influence municipal planning, in a manner which best addresses the needs of citizens.The Local Government Municipal Structures Act, 1998, requires amongst others municipalities to develop mechanisms to consult communities and community organisations in performing their functions and exercising their powers. These structures are commonly known as Ward Committees, and provide a vital link between Ward Councillors, the community and the municipality.In the coming months Ward Committees will be elected to serve their communities and citizens must avail themselves to participate in these elections and to serve on these structures.Cabinet welcomed the successful and peaceful municipal ward by-elections held recently in six provinces. South Africans have again demonstrated their commitment to political tolerance which is a testament to the maturity of our constitutional democracy.2.5. The SA Sport Awards Ceremony 2016 will be held on 27 November 2016 at the Sand du Plessis Theatre, Mangaung, Free State. Voting lines for the People s Choice Sports Star of the Year with its broadcast partner SABC Sport are open and will close on 27 November 2016 at 21h00. Cabinet commends all the People s Choice Sports Star of the Year Nominees.3. Cabinet s position on issues in the environment3.1. The impact of Climate Change is being felt through the severe weather conditions in the form of inconsistent rainfall, drought conditions, excessive heat and flash flooding. The flash floods in Gauteng and Mpumalanga resulted in the loss of lives, displaced communities especially in informal areas and destroyed infrastructure such as roads, bridges and property.Cabinet conveys its condolences to the family and friends of those who lost their lives in the flooding and wishes those injured a speedy recovery. The nations thoughts and prayers are with those whose loved ones are still missing. The country s Disaster Management teams remain on alert across the country, especially in areas where more rains are expected. All people must respect and respond to early warning of harsh weather.President Jacob Zuma accompanied by Gauteng Premier David Makhura and Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen inspected the area and visited homes that were flooded at the Stjwetla informal settlement along the Jukskei River. President Zuma has directed an intergovernmental intervention led by Minister van Rooyen to harness the Jukskei River and buttress its banks to reduce the impact of flash floods on communities. Cabinet thanks Community based NGOs, Ward Councillors and volunteers who came to the aide of residents.The recent rains should however not draw South Africans into a false sense of security as various parts of the country continue to experience drought conditions. Government has released water from the Sterkfontein Dam to Vaal Dam as a short term measure to help ease the situation and made an additional R212-million available in drought aid to support farmers in provinces that have been declared drought disaster areas.Cabinet calls on South Africans to be conscious of the impact their actions have on the environment and do all they can to save water.3.2. International ratings agencies Moody s, Fitch and Standard and Poors will in the coming weeks announce their decision on the country s investment rating grade. Government has been working with business, civil society and labour to translate the country s plans into concrete actions that will ensure South Africa remains an investment grade country. Cabinet calls on all sectors to join government in a united front to protect our country s investment status.3.3. The release of the 2015/16 audit results by the Auditor-General, Kimi Makwetu of national and provincial departments and their entities underscores the importance of performing the following basics properly and consistently: implementing plans to address deficiencies in financial controls based on commitments already made; providing effective leadership and monitoring achievement of performance targets; and reviewing and monitoring compliance with key laws and legislation over financial matters.Audit outcomes of national auditees showed an overall improvement of 8 per cent; 30 per cent of the auditees had a clean audit status and 14 per cent were either outstanding, disclaimed or had adverse opinions.The provincial level showed that the majority of departments had findings on compliance with key legislation and on the quality of their annual performance reports.Cabinet noted with concern the risks and challenges as highlighted in the audit results. It has committed government to address the pressing issues that have been identified and strengthen financial controls towards better audit outcomes.3.4. Cabinet welcomed the approximately 11 000 delegates who are participating at the 19th AfricaCom conference which is being held in Cape Town from 15 to 17 November 2016 under the theme  Harnessing the transformative power of Africa s digital revolution: the internet as an engine for economic development and social empowerment . The conference was addressed by Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services Dr Siyabonga Cwele and had over 350 speakers.AfricaCom has become a broad platform in developing the digital economy in Africa for socio-economic development and empowerment in support of Africa s Agenda 2063 programme. The conference attracts leaders of ICT, entrepreneurs and innovators from Africa and decision makers from over 140 countries. This year s conference focused on digital skills development, empowering women in technology, technology to tackle disabilities and supporting the African Tech Start-up Ecosystem. This provided a vehicle to realise the objectives of the NDP in terms of digital transformation, economic development and social empowerment.3.5. Cabinet is pleased that many students in higher education institutions across the country have responded positively to calls to save the 2016 academic programme. A number of institutions have started their final year examinations.We encourage students to remain focused on completing their studies and allow the Commission into the Feasibility of Fee-Free Higher Education and Training to complete its work.The work undertaken through NEDLAC is acknowledged, where the National Treasury presented proposals on how we could realise free education for tertiary students. A declaration will be finalised at the end of November 2016.The call by national church leaders and other faith leaders for solutions to the challenges in higher education are most welcome. Their support in mediation, prayer and peace efforts, along with their call for the 2016 academic year to be successfully concluded are welcomed.3.6. Cabinet welcomes the Constitutional Court decision on the Electronic National Traffic Information System (eNATIS) which will now be administered by government.3.7. We also noted the Constitutional Court Ruling that the application by Terry Crawford-Browne, to have the arms deal commission set aside, was not in the interest of justice. The Seriti Commission of Inquiry that probed the 1999 multi-billion-rand deal found that there was no evidence that any of the contracts were tainted by evidence of corruption, fraud or irregularities, this report was released by President Jacob Zuma in April 2016.3.8. Cabinet is concerned at the incitement of racial tensions and violence by public figures which detracts from our hard won freedom. South Africans must condemn detrimental influences such as the racist assault of Rethabile Mlotshwa which only serves to harm our fellow South Africans and does not add to the Ubuntu of our nation. We should also continue to respect the rule of law and speak out against unconstitutional calls to illegally occupy land in our communities.3.9. Cabinet respects the resignation of Mr. Brian Molefe as Group Chief Executive of Eskom and wishes him well in his future endeavours. Mr. Molefe has been instrumental in developing Eskom s turnaround strategy which is beginning to yield positive results. Cabinet is confident that he has left behind a strong executive team who will continue to deliver on Eskom s mandate and implementation of the turnaround strategy.3.10. Cabinet noted the allegations in an Al Jazeera documentary against Minister of State Security, Mr David Mahlobo, and noted that the South African Police Services are investigating the allegations.3.11. Cabinet highlighted that government has been at the forefront in the fight against environmental crimes, this includes work done within the security services as part of government s efforts to curb transnational organised crime and to ensure that justice prevails against those involved in syndicates.Cabinet congratulated the following:3.12. Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan who was recognised at the 2016 Sunday Times Top 100 Companies Awards by South Africa s captains of industry. This acknowledgement by the business community signals that we are in this together, and that collectively we have the will to change South Africa into a better place. The collective efforts of government, business, labour and civil society is moving onto higher trajectory to realising Vision 2030 of the NDP.3.13. Francois Groepe who was re-appointed as the Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, by President Jacob Zuma, for a period of five years with effect from 1 January 2017. 3.14. Gift of the Givers foundation founder Imtiaz Sooliman, who was awarded the Global Citizen Award by the international advisory firm Henley & Partners. This demonstrates that South African citizens are flying the flag high by giving so selflessly to people in need.3.15.

Our daily deeds as ordinary South Africans must produce an actual South African reality that will reinforce humanity s belief in justice, strengthen its confidence in the nobility of the human soul, and sustain all our hopes for a glorious life for all.    Nelson MandelaMadiba subscribed to the values of our Constitution and the vision of a free, just and united nation that underpins the society that we must work towards. To do this, South Africans need to be united by a shared vision of a better society.1. Implementation of government programmesSouth African Economy 1.1. Cabinet commends the effective partnership of Team South Africa   constituted by government, business, labour and all South Africans   for working together to safeguard South Africa s investment rating. Through hard work and unified action, the economy and investor confidence has been stabilised in these difficult economic times.President Jacob Zuma initiated Team SA to get different sectors to work together to reignite our economy, attract investment and create jobs for our people. These positive developments should motivate us to work even harder to move South Africa forward.1.2. Moody s Investor Services, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor s kept South Africa's sovereign debt credit rating status above sub-investment grade.Concerns raised by the agencies have been noted and together with our social partners we are fast tracking interventions to turnaround the economy. Cabinet remains confident that the path set out in the National Development Plan (NDP) and government s planned fiscal consolidation, together with the implementation of the Nine-Point Plan, will help South Africa remain an investment-grade country.1.3. Cabinet notes that South Africa s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.2% in the third quarter. The main contributors to GDP growth were the mining and quarrying sector, finance, real estate and business services, and general government services. The agriculture, forestry and fishing sector contracted by -0.3%; manufacturing by -3.2%; electricity, gas and water by -2.9%; and trade, catering and accommodation by -2.1%. Drought is still the largest contributor to the decline in the agriculture sector.1.4. The handover of title deeds to five Bahurutshe communities by the Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform, Mr Gugile Nkwinti, is one of the biggest land claims to be settled at Motsane Game Farm outside Zeerust in the North West.More than fifty-four thousand (54 280) hectares of land, which includes a game farm, is being restored.Also, the launch of the pilot project of the Policy Framework on Strengthening the Relative Rights of People Working the Land (50/50 policy) for North West at the Stars Away Farm in Ottoshoop, Zeerust, follows the conclusion of an agreement which will see farmworkers and the farmer become co-owners of the farming enterprise.1.5. Water infrastructure is part of government s National Infrastructure Plan to transform our economic landscape while creating new jobs and strengthening the delivery of basic services.The launch of the Mokolo and Crocodile River (West) Water Augmentation Project demonstrates government s commitment to respond to the needs of citizens. The water transfer infrastructure supplies water to the Lephalale Local Municipality, Eskom's power stations (Matimba and Medupi), the Zeeland water treatment plant, and Exxaro's Grootegeluk Mine. It also transfers water from the Crocodile River West near Thabazimbi to the Lephalale area.1.6. The Welgedacht Wastewater Treatment Works near Springs, Gauteng, underwent an extension to cope with the increased demand for wastewater treatment.In order to alleviate the pollution in the Vaal River System, the Department of Water and Sanitation refurbished the Oranjeville Waste Water Treatment Plant in the Metsimaholo District Municipality and Leeuwkuil Waste Water Treatment Plant in the Emfuleni District Municipality at a cost of R44.4 million. Also, over R300 million has been set aside to upgrade 26 dysfunctional waste water treatment works in parts of Gauteng and the Free State.1.7. The Orange-Senqu River Basin Commission is currently underway from 5 to 9 December 2016 at Emperors Palace in Kempton Park.

The recently held South African Local Government Association (SALGA) National Conference from 28 November to 1 December 2016 concluded with a recommitment to the Back to Basics programme and to promote inclusive living through the implementation of the Integrated Urban Development Framework (IUDF). The IUDF espouses the vision of creating  liveable, safe, resource-efficient cities and towns that are socially integrated, economically inclusive and globally competitive, where residents actively participate in urban life .  Activism for no violence against women and children1.11. The current 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children 2016 campaign under the theme:  Count Me In: Together Moving a Non-Violent South Africa Forward , launched by President Zuma, has set in motion the #365 days of Activism.

The Prevention and Combating of Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill, which is in the consultative phase, will strengthen enforcement and prosecution.Health1.13. The World AIDS Day commemoration on 1 December 2016, under the theme  It is in our hands to end HIV and TB , led by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, was boosted by the launch of new clinical trials for the HIV and AIDS vaccine known as HVTN 702.Cabinet applauds the South African scientists who are leading this critical research. The trial is one of the biggest in the world and bears testimony to the competency of the scientific and medical fraternity.1.14. Government continues in its partnership with all stakeholders   including PHILA and the South African National AIDS Council   to achieve an AIDS-free generation, stop all new HIV infections, end the TB epidemic and encourage all our citizens to make healthy, responsible choices.South Africa has achieved its targets for antiretroviral (ARV) treatment and we now have the largest ARV programme in the world, with 3.4 million people on treatment in 2015. The prevention of mother-to-child transmission target was reached, with a marked decline from more than 3.5% in 2010 to 1.8% in 2014. Sexual transmission of HIV among youth aged 15-24 years declined from 410 000 in 2011 to 330 000 in 2014. New TB infections and TB deaths declined, but the targets to achieve a 50% reduction in TB deaths were not reached.Over 800 million male condoms and over 20 million female condoms were distributed in the last financial year. The HIV-testing campaign saw 35 million HIV tests done over the five-year period. South Africa has over 300 GeneXpert machines deployed countrywide and over 2.1 million GeneXpert tests have been conducted. In 2016 South Africa implemented the universal test and treat programme where every HIV-positive person is put on treatment regardless of their CD4 cell count.Disaster Management 1.15. A meeting of SADC Ministers responsible for disaster risk management took place on 26 November 2016 in Mauritius chaired by the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Mr Des Van Rooyen.The meeting approved the Regional Disaster Preparedness and Response Strategy and set up a Task Force to finalise the proposal on the disaster preparedness and response fund. The SADC secretariat will convene a joint meeting of Ministers for Disaster Management and Finance to consider the proposed disaster preparedness and response fund.Youth1.16. As part of the programme to develop young people, the fifth national Youth Camp at the 3 South African Infantry Battalion, was opened next to Kimberley in the Northern Cape by the departments of Social Development and Defence and Military Veterans, under the theme #40YearsOn   Youth still moving South Africa forward.This brings together 1 000 young people across race, ethnicity, gender, class and language from all provinces with a view to promote national identity, nation-building, social cohesion, patriotism and active citizenry among young people of South Africa. Discussions will be held around the many challenges they face as youth.Since the first National Youth Camp in 2012, youth participants have undertaken a number of projects in their communities aimed at bringing about development. The Youth Camp provides an opportunity for young people, who are now leaders in their own right in their communities, to share their experiences with other youth.National Development Plan1.17. The NDP is a long-term vision and plan that serves as a blueprint for the work that needs to be done to achieve a prosperous society for South Africa by 2030. The core priorities of the NDP are to reduce poverty, unemployment and inequality.1.18. Cabinet calls on all sectors of society, business, labour and civil society to play their part in advancing the brand identity of the NDP by highlighting the implementation of the NDP through co-branding initiatives that are catalytic in implementing the plan.1.19. Cabinet undertook a photoshoot to symbolise a call to action that sees all sectors of society using the NDP brand identity.2. Cabinet decisions2.1. Cabinet supports the Minister of Transport, Ms Dipuo Peters, in directing Transnet National Ports Authority, in terms of Section 79, subsection (1) of the National Ports Act, 2005 (Act 12 of 2005), to amend the Terminal Operator s Agreement to allow the Strategic Fuel Fund to handle cargoes of Liquefied Petroleum Gas at the Port of Saldanha Bay. The Strategic Fuel Funds current lease and license will also be extended with a minimum of 25 years to provide commercial and operational certainty for sustainable investment in the oil and gas sector.This is in line with government priorities relating to Operation Phakisa on growing the Oceans Economy and broader goals outlined in the NDP, to promote economic growth and to boost job creation.2.2. Cabinet was briefed on the status of the Acid Mine Drainage  Emergency Works  project that was implemented as a short-term solution for Acid Mine Drainage mitigation in the Witwatersrand goldfields. A long-term solution will be implemented in line with recommendations set down by the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC).Being a water-scarce country, the Acid Mine Drainage project capitalises on water conservation and reuse, ensuring the provision of adequately treated drinking water and a move away from the sole reliance on clean water in industrial applications. Further, the project also mitigates pollution and other negative impacts.2.3. Cabinet approved the National Sanitation Policy, 2016 for implementation. This follows an extensive period of consultation for inputs. The policy places the well-being of people at the centre of development and is forward looking in terms of improved levels of services, innovation and appropriate technology to ensure sustainability to improve the lives of the poor.2.4. Cabinet approved the release of the National Crime Statistics report for the first two quarters of 2016/17, by the Minister of Police, Mr Nkosinathi Nhleko. The quarterly releases enables government to monitor key targets, in particular the reduction of reported serious crimes, as set out in the MTSF and could be used as early warning to strengthen the crime-prevention operations and strategies of various government departments. Minister Nhleko will release these crime statistics before 31 January 2017.2.5. Cabinet approved the Second Country Report on the implementation of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (Children s Charter) for submission to the AU in January 2017.The Children's Charter was adopted by the African Union in 1990 and is a comprehensive instrument that sets out rights and defines universal principles and norms for the status of children. The Second Country Report outlines progress made on the implementation of a suite of government-wide policies and legislation to promote, protect and realise children s rights. The report also recognises the continuous and progressive efforts to strengthen implementation of programmes and projects to promote the rights of children.2.6. Cabinet was briefed on the outcomes from the 17th Meeting of the Conference of Parties (CoP17) to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which was hosted by South Africa from 24 September to 5 October 2016.Parties agreed to measures and actions to be implemented within the mandate of the Convention to ensure legal international trade remains sustainable and illegal trade is eradicated. Parties also agreed to recognise that people need to benefit from the sustainable utilisation of its natural resources, including from legal international trade.2.7. Cabinet approved South Africa s negotiating positions for the 13th Meeting of the CoP to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP13) and its protocols to be held in Cancun, Mexico from 4 to 17 December 2016.CBD COP13 will consider the following key issues: Resource Mobilisation; Mainstreaming and the Integration of Biodiversity within and across sectors; and Marine and Coastal Biodiversity.2.8. Cabinet was briefed on progress made by government in responding to the attacks on foreign nationals and addressing the root causes. Guided by the IMC on Migration, government implemented Operation Fiela, which brought the violence under control. From 1 July to 30 September 2015, 702 operations were conducted, which led to 9 741 arrests of which 3 158 were of foreign nationals.Work on the root cause of the attacks determined that there was an increased competition for economic opportunities, resources and public services between foreign nationals and poor unemployed South Africans residing in townships and informal settlements.Final approval of the White Paper on International Migration is planned for March 2017, and will include the  First Safe Country  principle that will assist in managing refugees and asylum seekers. Cabinet also approved the Refugee Amendment Bill in September 2015 for tabling in Parliament and Home Affairs submitted a document to the Southern African Development Community inviting discussion on how to deal with migration in the region. Land was also acquired in Lebombo, Mpumalanga in 2015 to set up asylum-processing centres closer to the border.2.9. Cabinet was updated on implementation of the National Evaluation System detailed in the Annual Report on Evaluation 2016 to 2017 and also approved the sixth National Evaluation Plan 2017 to 2018.The National Evaluation System is being institutionalised across government and is building a body of evidence following 16 economic evaluations: six agricultural/ rural evaluations; seven human settlements evaluations and an evidence map; five children evaluations; and four safety evaluations (with two additional safety evaluations starting).Cabinet reinforced that departments should allocate necessary funding for effective and efficient monitoring and evaluation to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of programmes.2.10. Cabinet was briefed on the findings and recommendations from the study conducted by the Department of Public Service and Administration (DPSA) on the geographic accessibility of Thusong Service Centres, government s one-stop service centres providing information and services to communities.The study recommends a more equitable distribution of Centres and the clustering of existing service points of key departments so as to maximise the number of people who can access services, reduce the distance and cost of travelling; and minimise the need for additional infrastructure investment. In addition to the 197 existing Thusong Centres, the study identified and recommends 67 additional locations where access to service needs to be improved to meet population demands and reduce travel distances to Service Centres.2.11. Cabinet was briefed on the provisions of the directive on compulsory capacity development, mandatory training days and maximum entry requirements for the Senior Management Service (SMS). This will improve the quality of human resources, which is a critical factor in the capacity of government to deliver on its mandate and contributes to the NDP focus on building a capable and developmental state.2.12. Cabinet approved the 2.5% cost-of-living adjustment to the remuneration levels of members from the South African Human Rights Commission, with effect from 1 April 2016.3. BillsCabinet approved for the introduction of the following Bills into Parliament:3.1.

Traditional Courts Bill of 2016, contributes to realising a developmental, capable and ethical state by regulating the role and functions of the institution of traditional leadership in the resolution of disputes, in accordance with the Constitution of South Africa.  This will improve access to justice services by all with the view to promote social cohesion.3.3. Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill of 2016, which amends the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977 (Act 51 of 1977).The amendments provide the courts with wider discretion in issuing orders in respect of vulnerable groups, namely persons with a mental disability. The courts will also be assisted to make legally and procedurally correct decisions that are based on reports of expert panels that have been correctly constituted.4. Upcoming events4.1. Zambia s President Edgar Lungu is on a State Visit to South Africa from 8 to 9 December 2016. It is expected that a Joint Permanent Commission between the two countries will be inaugurated, which will oversee the 1996 General Agreement and the 1999 Declaration of Intent which gives effect to bilateral agreements.The two countries have good bilateral and economic relations, with Zambia remaining one of South Africa s top three trading partners on the African continent. South African exports to Zambia in 2014 were R29.5 billion, while Zambia s exports to South Africa reached R3.6 billion.4.2. Cabinet approved for South Africa to host the Information and Communications Technology Africa 2017 Summit in partnership with AfricanBrains in July 2017. This will be led by the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services.4.3. On 9 December 2016, our government in partnership with the United Nations (UN) Office on Drugs and Crime and the University of South Africa, will once again mark International Anti-Corruption Day under the theme:  United Against Corruption . which resonates with the injunction of the National Development Plan to foster an active citizenry that will partner with government in the fight against corruption.Since 2014 we have ensured the conviction of a total of ninety (90) persons and legal entities for corruption and corruption related matters. Thirty-two were for cases where the total amount involved is R5 million per case amounting to about R3.8 billion.[1]  The remaining fifty-eight (58) persons convicted were for amounts less than R5 million per case, the total amount involved was in the order of R188 million.  In the same period, we have been able to obtain eight hundred and seventy-one (871) freezing orders totalling R7.65 billion as well as one thousand and eighty-nine (1089) forfeiture/confiscation orders to the value of R2.86 billion.Corruption is being addressed through a suite of mechanisms, which include: the Code of Conduct for the Public Service; the establishment of specialised anti-corruption units such as the South African Police Service (SAPS) Organised Crime Unit; the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation; the National Prosecuting Authority s Specialised Commercial Crimes Unit; the Asset Forfeiture Unit and the Financial Intelligence Centre. Efforts are boosted by Specialised Commercial Crime Courts and the creation of the national and sectoral anti-corruption hotlines.4.4. 2016 marks the 20th anniversary of the signing into law of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996 by former President Nelson Mandela in Sharpeville on 10 December 1996.The Constitution laid the foundation for a democratic and open society in which government is based on the will of the people. It is the product of a long process of struggle and multiparty political negotiations in which politicians, lawyers and representatives of civil society played a role. It is regarded as one of the most progressive and transformative constitutions in the world.To commemorate the 20th anniversary under the theme  Celebrating 20 years of the Constitution   transforming society and uniting the nation , government will undertake a series of community engagements and programmes to increase awareness and knowledge of the Constitution, its values and human rights.

Cabinet extends its best wishes to all South Africans for the upcoming festive season.  We call on our fellow South Africans to assist individuals and families in their communities, especially children, older persons and people with disabilities.4.7. The announcement by the SAPS that shopping malls will also become a priority during the festive season goes further in ensuring that South Africans are and feel safe. The deployment of police members and trainees at various malls across the country forms part of the Back-to-Basics approach of the SAPS to improve visibility, enhance policing and curb various crimes which tend to spike during the festive season.Cabinet urges all South Africans, in line with the responsibilities outlined in our NDP, to be part of the solution and ensure a safe and enjoyable festive season for all.As South Africans take to the road to visit loved ones and family members, please be alert and ensure that vehicles are roadworthy. Adherence to the speed limit, wearing safety belts and not driving while under the influence are non-negotiables in ensuring your own safety and that of other people around you. As we enjoy the upcoming festive period, please continue to use water wisely and efficiently as water remains a scarce resource.5. Past yearThe past year witnessed a growing number of investment initiatives that have been announced in the country, which demonstrate confidence by the international investment community in South Africa s economy. It further demonstrates that our country is on a path to recovery and continues to be a viable investment destination. Implementation of the Nine-Point Plan, the MTSF and interventions such as Operation Phakisa have placed us on a higher trajectory to realise Vision 2030 of the NDP.We created new trade opportunities aimed at opening market access and deepening existing economic ties. This was implemented through bilateral meetings with targeted Government Ministries, meetings with potential investors, engagements with various Chambers of Commerce as well as taking part in national pavilions and tourism promotion events.These initiatives yielded increased sales of manufactured value-added exports by R 1.2 billion which brings the cumulative total for the year to R3.8 billion. Further, the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows pipeline represents potential FDI of R13.1 billion particularly in the energy and chemicals sector. This brings the total potential FDI for 2016 to R30 billion.International tourism continues to be an important part of our economic diplomacy efforts, contributing to job creation and economic growth. Tourist arrivals figures went up by 14, 8% in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. A total of about R39.3 billion foreign direct spend was achieved during the first months of 2016, which contributes to job creation and sustains the local economy. This information confirms that South Africa remains a popular destination for international tourists.As part of the National Infrastructure Plan we have seen infrastructure investments in education, health, water, energy and transport. All of which have created employment and improved the lives of our people. The stabilisation of the grid has strengthened reliable electricity supply for South Africa.Various international agenda engagements resulted in a suite of memorandums of understanding and agreements being signed. These serve as a catalyst for economic development initiatives and to meet our goals from the NDP.We held a successful Local Government Election and also hosted, in the spirit of Ubuntu, various mega events. These included: AfricaCom; Africa Internet Governance Forum; COP17) to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES); the 35th International Geological Congress; the 21st International AIDS Conference and many others.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 15 February 2017,16 Feb 2017,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-15-february-2017-16-feb-2017-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-15-february-2017-16-feb-2017-0000,"1. Implementation of Government Programmes1.1. Cabinet welcomes President Jacob Zuma s 2017 State of the Nation Address (SoNA) under the theme ""Radical Transformation of the Economy . This was at the halfway mark of this Fifth Administration s term of office which saw 2017 being declared the Year of Oliver Reginald Tambo and the year of deepening unity.President Jacob Zuma outlined progress we are making in realising our vision of a National Democratic Society and the key actions required to move us closer and faster to a united, non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and prosperous society.The President reflected on the implementation of Government s programme and announced concrete actionable plans for effective implementation of the National Development Plan, which underpins the Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) 2014-2019. SoNA 2017 clearly demonstrated that consolidated efforts by government, business and labour in implementing the Nine Point Plan are beginning to have an impact.Cabinet reiterates the President s call to intensify efforts aimed at driving radical economic transformation and efforts to fast-track implementation.Cluster Ministers are in the process of post-SoNA media briefings to elaborate on Government s 2017/18 Programme of Action. The 2017/18 Budget Speech will further map out the allocation of resources to the various government programmes as highlighted by the President.1.2. The outcomes of the Investing in African Mining Conference that was held in Cape Town demonstrates the country s competitive advantage in the areas of mining and related fields.The mining sector remains the cornerstone of the South African economy contributing 8 per cent to the country s GDP, employing around 460 000 people and earning foreign exchange. South Africa continues to be a productive and rewarding destination for investors in mining with an estimated $2.5 to 3 trillion in non-energy mineral reserves still in-situ.The amendments to the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act by June 2017 and gazetting of the revised Mining Charter by March 2017 contribute to the creation of an enabling regulatory environment which encourages investment, trade and enterprise development in an equitable and socially responsible manner.1.3. The Indaba was bolstered by Invest Africa which is a platform for business leaders, investors and entrepreneurs to gain insight and exposure to information and opportunities from Africa.1.4. Cabinet welcomes the Settlement Agreement reached between the construction industry and Government, also known as the Voluntary Rebuilding Programme (VRP).This Agreement sets company-level targets for transformation, either through the sale of a minimum of 40% of shares to black South Africans or through partnerships with smaller black-owned construction companies, to help increase their turnover to 25% of the listed company turnover, over a seven-year period.This is the most far-reaching sector agreement on transformation reached with government to date and can help to give effect to Government's vision of radical economic transformation. It is also a model that can be drawn on for transformation in other sectors.Cabinet congratulates the signatories to the agreement and urges all other construction companies in the sector who are not currently parties to the agreement, to follow this lead and join in the partnership that is being built, through making similar commitments in order to further boost the transformation of the sector.1.5. Cabinet applauds all social partners at the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) on the historic agreement on the introduction of a National Minimum Wage of R20 an hour with effect from no later than May 2018.The agreement on a National Minimum Wage and other measures to strengthen labour stability and collective bargaining is an important step in creating a more equal, just and prosperous society as envisaged in the National Development Plan (NDP).The national minimum wage, which is a floor below which no worker may be paid, will significantly improve the lives of millions of low paid workers and begin to address the challenge of wage inequality.The wage has been set at an initial level that will make a real difference in the lives of ordinary South Africans while minimising any adverse effects on employment. Businesses that are unable to afford the national minimum wage may apply for a temporary exemption, while measures are being considered to assist fragile sectors of the economy.1.6. The unemployment challenge remains a top government priority and all programmes and interventions are geared towards turning the situation around, especially in this tough economic environment.Cabinet welcomes the increase in jobs in the economy over the fourth quarter of 2016 when 235 000 jobs were created, according to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey. The increase was largely driven by employment in the country s services sector, followed by transport and manufacturing.The growth in jobs over the quarter resulted in a slight decrease in the unemployment rate to 26.5%.1.7. Cabinet thanks all parents, teachers, lecturers and administrators on the successful start of the 2017 academic year. Education is one of our key priorities and central to achieving Vision 2030 of the National Development Plan (NDP).1.8. Cabinet commends the dedication of the Class of 2016 as we celebrate the achievement rate increase from 70.7 per cent in 2015 to 72.5 per cent in 2016. Cabinet wishes all learners well and looks forward to further improvement in the achievement rate from the Class of 2017.Cabinet also commends the learners who will be sitting for the supplementary matric examination between 11 February 2017 and 18 March 2017 for their perseverance.1.9. As part of government efforts to galvanise society to protect the right to education, the Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation will convene the National Development Plan Back to School Izimbizo on 25 February 2017 in all provinces. Education is the foundation for all government programmes and all Members of the Executive will be participating.Community members are invited to join members of Cabinet, Members of Parliament, Premiers and leaders in local government as they visit schools, tertiary institutions and other educational centres.1.10. In line with the prescripts of the Freedom Charter that  higher education and technical training shall be opened to all by means of state allowances and scholarships awarded on the basis of merit , Government through the National Student Financial Aid Scheme is funding more than 20 000 new students at 23 universities.This is in addition to the 107 000 returning students from 25 universities and 737 747 returning students from 35 Technical and Vocational Education and Training colleges.1.11. Our government continues to explore various models in finding sustainable solutions to funding and opening up opportunities for the poor and the middle-class to pursue post school education and training. The Ikusasa Student Financial Aid Programme (ISFAP) is an innovative public private partnership led by the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) that assists the  missing middle .The project is being piloted with six universities and one technical and vocational education training (TVET) college and will be funding the studies of approximately 1 500 students studying in a number of general formative degrees, as well as seven professional qualifications and one artisan qualification for the duration of their studies.They will also receive academic support, social support, life skills training, mentoring and medical support where required. More than R200 million will be needed to enable the pilot to succeed and will mainly be sourced from the private sector.1.12. The second World Skills South Africa Competition which is being hosted by the Department of Higher Education and Training at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre in Durban from 13 to 17 February 2017, celebrates the talent of young artisans and technicians in the country.It also serves as an advocacy programme to highlight the importance of the artisanal sector in the country s economy. Winners go on to represent South Africa at the World Skills International Competition in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates in October 2017.1.13. President Jacob Zuma s unannounced visit to Nyanga Police station in Cape Town coincided with the release of the 2015/16 Victims of Crime Survey by Statistics South Africa. The successful visit, as part of the Presidential Siyahlola Monitoring programme, gained first-hand account of work that is being done to fight crime in the area.Departments from the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster are in the process of attending to challenges faced by the Police Station.1.14. The Victims of Crime Survey is important as it guides government in formulating its policies in the fight against crime. This is in line with the government priority that All People in South Africa Are and Feel Safe. The results assist in guiding further work that needs to be done, to match the good news on achievements over the last five years, with perceptions and experiences of citizens.2. Cabinet decisions2.1. The Implementation Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Environmental Governance in the Mining Sector, included the management response and improvement plan by the Department of Environmental AffairsThe National Environmental Management Act, 1998 defines the environmental management approach that should be integrated across all sectors, including the mining sector. The objective is to ensure that the environmental impacts of mining activities are effectively mitigated or managed. The evaluation assessed the relevance and effectiveness of the legislation and its implementation to achieve this objective.Cabinet supports the  One Environment System  as proposed in the Improvement Plan with a mandate to consider additional streamlining measures such as further alignment of Specific Environmental Management Acts. Cabinet also supports a discussion on mine closures to ensure environmental protection and to reduce socio-economic risk to surrounding communities.2.2. The 2015/16 Research and Development (R&D) Tax Incentive Annual Report which is being submitted to Parliament, shows how the R&D Tax Incentive programme is promoting increased private sector R&D investment. This is required to increase the economy s capacity to boost employment creation, as well as to increase positive spillovers through knowledge transfer and skills development.From March 2015 to February 2016, the Department of Science and Technology received 189 R&D tax incentive applications from 147 companies.This increased the total number of companies participating in the incentive programme since its inception in November 2006, to 962. In this period the National Treasury estimates that just over R6 billion in tax revenue was foregone as a result of the R&D tax incentive. Over the same period the incentive supported about R36.1 billion in R&D expenditure.Of the 962 companies, 47% are Small and Medium Enterprises, 12% are large enterprises (turnover R41 million to R100 million); 32% are very large enterprises (R100 million and above); and 8% did not disclose their turnover size.2.3. Cabinet approved the introduction of a process for the coordination of the government s budget for Research & Development (R&D) activities.The National Development Plan notes that R&D and innovation have a key role to play in improving the competitiveness of the South African economy and in supporting socio-economic development and employment.South Africa s critical national scientific infrastructure is obsolete and in urgent need of technological upgrading and modernising to sustain effective service delivery. Such infrastructure is large and expensive, and would require coordinated investment across departments.The proposed budget coordination will be phased in over the medium term 2016/17 and 2019/20.2.4. Cabinet was briefed on the progress made in the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and MeerKAT projects, the planned establishment of the merged South African Radio Astronomy Observatory, and the hosting of the Hydrogen Epoch of Re-ionisation Array (HERA) telescope on the SKA site.The SKA and MeerKAT constitute one of eighteen Strategic Infrastructure Projects of the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission. These mega infrastructure projects contribute to the National Development Plan through their potential to promote economic development, unlock economic opportunities and promote job creation.Good progress is being made on the preparations for SKA-1 in South Africa including the acquisition of land and negotiations on the international treaty and the procurement process. In its ten years the SKA SA Human Capital Development Programme awarded over 800 bursaries, with extensive support to schools in Carnarvon.The MeerKAT  first light  image of the radio sky produced with only 16 antennae shows more than 13003 radio galaxies in the distant universe, demonstrating that it is the best radio telescope in the Southern Hemisphere and should be the world s best telescope of its kind, once completed. The full complement of 64 antennae will be installed and operational by March 2018, and is being built with 75% local content so as to prepare the local industry for deeper participation.HERA is a complementary scientific experiment to advance understanding of early galaxy formation and if funded mainly by the National Science Foundation of the United States in partnership with Cambridge University.The concept of a single radio astronomy observatory, to be known as the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory will consolidate the different projects and activities of the South African radio astronomy landscape. There are efficiency gains to be made with a single new National Facility under the National Research Foundation.2.5. The White Paper on National Civil Aviation Policy, which promotes and enhances civil aviation safety, security and environmental compliance, was approved. It also promotes the national interest of South Africa and facilitates the expansion of trade and tourism. Further it promotes the development of an efficient and productive aviation industry, which is capable of competing both locally and internationally.2.6. Cabinet also approved the National Airports Development Plan which was initiated by the White Paper on National Civil Aviation Policy to address the gaps between the current airport network and the future desired state.It will guide and support both overall network planning and the development of individual airports integrated within their broader spatial and transport contexts, in consultation with key airport stakeholders.Airport infrastructure is an integral part of the South African transport system and contributes to the socio-economic development of the country by facilitating domestic and international tourism and trade.2.7. The draft Comprehensive Maritime Transport Policy 2016, was approved, for public comments.This provides a national framework to guide the integrated governance, growth, development and transformation of the maritime sector, with a view to unlock the maritime sectors  full potential and enhance its contribution to the socio-economic development objectives of the country, while contributing to international trade.This is in line with Government priorities relating to Operation Phakisa on growing the Oceans Economy and broader goals from the National Development Plan 2030 and the National Infrastructure Plan to promote economic growth and to boost job creation.3. Bills3.1. Submission of the Draft Marine Spatial Planning Bill, 2016 to Parliament. The Bill provides a legal framework for the development of a marine spatial planning system that promotes economic growth; and is facilitated by coordinating planning across multiple sectors.It will promote good ocean governance by ensuring involvement of all sectors in joint management and planning in the ocean space. It will also facilitate: conflict resolution (amongst the users of space and regulatory authorities); enhancement of information; knowledge and management in South African ocean space.The Bill will work towards sustainable development, rather than only conservation or environmental protection, with a view to contribute to more general social and economic objectives. It is also a key initiative of the first Operation Phakisa (Ocean Economy) to unlock our economic potential.3.2. Submission of the Agricultural Products Standards Amendment Bill to Parliament. The Bill amends the Agricultural Products Standards Act, 1990 (Act No. 119 of 1990)The Bill aims to strengthen the regulatory framework for agricultural production, health and food safety of certain agricultural products. Such a regulatory framework promotes food safety and creates an enabling environment for increased and sustainable production. This will increase fair trade practices and consumer protection.3.3. Publication of the Draft Electronic Deeds Registration Systems Bill, 2016, for public comment.The Bill facilitates the development, establishment and maintenance of an electronic deeds registration system that will provide, amongst other things, for the effective registration of large volumes of deeds as a result of our Government s land reform measures, improved turn-around times for providing registered deeds and documents to clients; provide country-wide access to deeds registration services; enhanced accuracy of examination and registration; availability of information to the public; and security features including confidentiality.This also supports the National Development Plan call for measures to be implemented in all government departments and sectors that effectively manage information and technology to ensure that South Africa does not fall victim to a  digital divide .4. Issues in the Environment4.1. Cabinet joins President Jacob Zuma in extending condolences to the families and friends of mentally ill patients who died in Gauteng. Government, and society at large, has a responsibility to protect and care for the vulnerable.Cabinet commends the Minister of Health, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi for appointing the Health Ombudsman to investigate all wrong doings committed by health institutions and health practitioners.Further, the action being taken by the Premier of Gauteng, David Makhura, based on the report of the Health Ombudsman, is welcomed. Cabinet further calls on Premier Makhura to ensure that appropriate disciplinary action is taken against all who may have conducted themselves improperly or negligently.4.2. Cabinet was concerned about the disorderly behaviour displayed at the Opening of Parliament which not only infringe on the rights of others in Parliament, but on the rights of all South Africans.Parliament is one of South Africa s founding democratic institutions, established by the Constitution, to uphold the Bill of Rights and account to the people of South Africa   all of whom have entrusted us with the responsibility of leading them towards a better life. Members of Parliament, as representatives of the people must put the interests of all South Africans first and reassert the role of this important institution.4.3. Cabinet was apprised on Tropical Cyclone Dineo, with South Africa set to experience severe storms and heavy rains starting from today, Thursday, 16 February 2017 until the weekend - Sunday 19 February 2017.The Cyclone will affect Mpumalanga, the extreme northern parts of Kwa Zulu Natal and Limpopo. This will mostly affect   Kruger National Park, Enhlanzeni, Vhembe, Mopani and Waterberg district Municipalities.The eastern parts of Limpopo may also experience high levels of rainfall on Friday, estimated at 200 mm over a 24-hour period.The National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC) and the National Joint Operations Centre (NATJOC) comprising of various government departments and institutions have assessed the situation and activated three Provincial Joint Operations Centres (PROVJOC) in Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal.This multi-sectoral approach will assist where the need arises to ensure safety of communities and to minimise the impact.Government is appealing to all affected communities to take extra care ahead of this coming cyclone. Communities are discouraged from crossing flooded roads, bridges and rivers.We also urge parents, care givers and guardians to ensure the safety of their children during the storms. Communities must work together to ensure the safety of people. Please listen for warnings and information on Tropical Cyclone Dineo which is being broadcast across all local radio stations.4.4. Cabinet fully supports the intervention and community engagement by the government delegation, being led by Minister of Home Affairs, Malusi Gigaba, and the Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane to engage on issues affecting communities in the area, in particular matters around policing and the alleged illegal activities of migrants.Cabinet supports the Minister s call for  a whole of state approach  to these legitimate issues raised by communities, which will be addressed through: the establishment of a Border Management Authority that will help in better managing our borders, documentation of all people living in South Africa, effective policing and ensuring compliance to the laws and the Constitution of the Republic by citizens and foreign nationals.Cabinet gives full support to the security cluster, to ensure that these matters are resolved to the satisfaction of the South African public. This will require better dialogue around policing between communities and the authorities.Cabinet further wishes to call for responsible public comments by all leaders and representatives, issues must be handled in a responsible manner.4.5. In a separate incident, Cabinet condemns the attacks on fans, players and officials during the Absa Premiership match between Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates at Loftus Versfeld which left 13 people injured.Such behaviour and acts of hooliganism brings the sport into disrepute, reflects negatively on the country and requires stringent action from soccer authorities that must act swiftly to ensure such acts are not repeated.5. Sympathy and congratulatory messages5.1. Cabinet expresses its condolences to family, friends and the rugby fraternity on the passing of former Springbok captain Joost van der Westhuizen. President Jacob Zuma had also declared a Special Provincial Official Funeral to commemorate the South African rugby legend.5.2.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 1 March 2017,2 Mar 2017,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-1-march-2017-2-mar-2017-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-1-march-2017-2-mar-2017-0000,"1. Implementation of Government Programmes1.1. Cabinet supports the commitments made in the 2017 National Budget to advance radical economic transformation and draw more South Africans into the economy towards inclusive growth. In the main the budget acknowledges that growth without transformation would only reinforce the inequitable patterns from the past.Redistribution in support of education, health services and municipal functions in rural areas remains the central thrust of our spending programmes. Procurement reforms continue to improve the effectiveness of public spending and opening opportunities for small business participation.Budget allocations support economic growth and development: R3.9 billion for small, medium and micro enterprises and cooperatives; R4.2 billion for industrial infrastructure in special economic zones and industrial parks; R1.9 billion for broadband implementation, R3.9 billion for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, an additional R494 million for tourism promotion, an additional R266m to support the aquaculture sector and realise the goals of the Oceans Economy Phakisa Operation, and spending on agriculture, rural development and land reform amounting to nearly R30 billion by 2019/20.The budget plays a central role in transformation by promoting redistribution and directing scarce resources towards catalytic investments in human and physical capital.1.2. In recognition of our need to invest in the future of youth, the budget ensures that financially needy students can access tertiary education. The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) has provided funding to over 300 000 new and returning students to study at universities and Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges across the country in 2017. The fund expects to add a further 100 000 students this year. The R15 billion allocated to NSFAS by government will assist in alleviating the financial burden faced by financially needy and missing middle students.1.3. Following the successful launch of Operation Phakisa in sectors such as the Oceans Economy, Health and Basic Education, President Jacob Zuma launched the Operation Phakisa for Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development on 24 February 2017. Operation Phakisa is derived from Malaysia s Big Fast Results methodology which Malaysia used successfully to achieve rapid economic transformation; and having been successfully adapted to South African conditions, it now forms part of our Nine Point Plan Implementation toolkit.Operation Phakisa for Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development seeks to achieve inclusive growth, as prescribed by the vision of the NDP and aims at contributing to stimulating economic growth, fostering job creation, and transforming the agricultural value chain. It further seeks to ensure equitable access to land, both towards economic development and agrarian transformation.The programme will review existing producer support models and develop finance models aimed at fast tracking land reform, given the urgent need for government to make progress in food security. Furthermore, the programme seeks to address constraints in ensuring equitable access to land, both towards economic development and agrarian transformation. These include land reform, rural development, labour, grains, livestock, horticulture and producer support.1.4. In 2016, over 10 million tourist arrivals were recorded in South Africa, a 13 per cent increase from 2015. Our thriving tourism industry is testament to the close collaboration between government, organised labour and business led by the Department of Tourism together with South African Tourism to unlock the full economic benefits of our tourism assets. We call on all industry partners to continue developing and promoting tourism so that it may benefit local communities through jobs and infrastructure development.1.5. As part of Government focus to unlock the potential of SMME s and township enterprises, South Africa will host the Global Entrepreneurship Congress between the 13 and16 March 2017 in Johannesburg. The congress is an inter-disciplinary gathering of start-up champions that attracts 4 000 delegates from more than 150 countries.  Thought-leaders, entrepreneurs, investors, researchers and policymakers who have become part of a global movement that advances entrepreneurship as a means to build economies and improve human welfare, will attend.This is the first time the congress will be hosted in Africa and provides an opportunity for South Africa and the rest of the continent to ignite its entrepreneurial spirit.  1.6. South Africa commemorated the start of Human Rights Month on 1 March 2017 under the theme:  The Year of OR Tambo: Unity in Action in Advancing Human Rights  to raise awareness and promote respect for basic human rights.Human Rights Month will be celebrated across the country leading to the national celebrations on Human Rights Day on 21 March 2017 in Ginsberg, King William s Town in the Eastern Cape.On the day, President Jacob Zuma will officially handover the memorial grave site of Steve Bantu Biko to the Biko-family. This is part of celebrating and promoting unity in line with the vision of OR Tambo.1.7. Cabinet also noted the outcome of the Competition Commission investigation into alleged foreign exchange collusion and awaits the conclusion of the Competition Tribunal proceedings, including its findings and decision on the appropriate sanction.1.8. As we commemorate National Water Month in March 2017 under the theme:  Human Rights for Water and Sanitation , all South Africans are reminded to conserve water to ensure sustainability of future supply.Cabinet was briefed on the proposal by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) to host World Water Day in South Africa on 22 March 2017 under the theme:  Waste Water the untapped resource .President Jacob Zuma who is a member of the United Nations High Level Panel on Water Action Plan will open the event, by launching the World Water Development Report 2017 on wastewater and related activities.1.9. Cabinet welcomes the progress made on the distribution of animal feeds to support farmers in the country s drought affected areas. The initiative is part of the R212 million in support, which government has made available in 2016/17 to assist affected farmers across the country.Provinces have also made R198 million available through equitable share funding, and funds from the Prevention and Mitigation of Disaster Risk programme were used to drill boreholes and construct fire breaks.1.10. In order to assist with the difficulties with regard to water availability in the Western Cape, attempts need to be instituted to provide greater comfort in the form of additional alternate water supply sources that must be on standby should inadequate water be received for this season.To further curb excessive water use, the Department of Water and Sanitation has informed the agricultural sector of 10% additional water restrictions.  The water restrictions will remain until the dams fill up to 85% of their capacity.1.11. As the country welcomes the much needed rains which will go a long way in relieving the country from the effects of drought, dams and rivers are showing signs of increasing volumes. The possibility of flash flooding remains high. We call on communities to remain vigilant of flash flooding which could lead to the loss of life, destruction to property and infrastructure. Government and its agencies are actively monitoring the situation and are ready to act where necessary.1.12. President Jacob Zuma will deliver his annual address to the National House of Traditional Leaders on 3 March 2017.Emanating from the Address a Programme of Action will be developed and implemented by the House and the Department of Traditional Affairs. The official opening of the house will also celebrate 20 years since it was constituted.1.13. President Jacob Zuma will lead a South African government delegation to the SADC Extraordinary Summit on 18 March 2017, in the Kingdom of Swaziland. SADC continues to serve as the primary vehicle for South Africa s foreign policy to achieve regional development and integration within our region.It is expected that the Summit will deliberate on, amongst other things, the state of peace and security in the region, with particular focus on the developments in the Kingdom of Lesotho and the Democratic Republic of Congo and the implementation of the Revised Regional Indicative Strategic Plan.South Africa as the incoming Chair of SADC is scheduled to host the next SADC Ordinary Summit in August 2017.1.14. On 8 March President Jacob Zuma will undertake an official State Visit to Indonesia. Both South Africa and Indonesia are one of the largest economies in their respective regions, and endowed with rich natural and maritime resources.1.15. This will be preceded by the Leaders' Summit of the Indian Ocean RIM Association (IORA) from 6 to 7 March 2017, which will also commemorate IORA's 20th anniversary. At that Summit, President Widodo will hand over the chairship of IORA to South Africa.South Africa and Indonesia are both founding members of IORA, which comprises 21 coastal states of the Indian Ocean. South Africa served as Vice Chair from 2015 to early 2017 and will serve as Chair from 2017 to 2019.2. Cabinet decisions2.1. Cabinet approved the gazetting of the draft Mine Water Management Policy for public comment. Mine Water Management, including Acid Mine Drainage, remains a major environmental challenge.The Policy provides the basis for holding parties potentially liable for negative effects and damages of Acid Mine Drainage related pollution and/or any other negative impacts that can be related to it. The policy also seeks to propose mechanisms that mining houses should explore to better manage their water.2.2. Cabinet was briefed on the progress report of the Inter-Ministerial Committee for the Revitalisation of Distressed Mining Communities  implementation of relevant findings from its Australian Mining Industry Benchmarking Study tour of 24 to 28 August 2015.The study tour was premised on the Rapid Appraisal of the Policy and Regulatory Systems Governing the Mining Sector which compared the policy and legislative frameworks governing the mining sector as well as the practices of mining companies in Australia, Chile, South Africa and Zambia.Highlights of progress include partnerships between government and mining companies in delivering decent housing and living conditions for mine workers and community members; A review of mining companies water treatment plants is being conducted to assess the possibility of infrastructure partnerships. The development of mining towns spatial transformation plans has been finalised for five municipalities. Catalytic economic development projects are being implemented in labour sending areas, with an emphasis on the advancement of the agriculture sector in mining communities; and fast tracking of increased access to medical assessments for ex-mineworkers, community members and current mineworkers.Cabinet approved for the Departments of Labour and Mineral Resources to study the different Australian mine commuting models to assist long haul South African migrant mineworkers to commute home more frequently.Cabinet also approved for the Department of Health work closely with the Department of Mineral Resources and other partners in the provision of supportive services to ex-mineworkers in dealing with occupational diseases, with a view to reducing and preventing mine related occupational health challenges.A request was made for the Department of Human Settlements to fast track the implementation of integrated human settlements projects in collaboration with mining companies.2.3. Cabinet approved the improvement plan based on the findings and recommendations of the synthesis evaluation of whether the provision of state subsidised housing has addressed asset poverty for households and local municipalities.Over 3 million houses have been provided through the government housing programme. 2.8 million of the houses are delivered through the capital subsidy which confers individual ownership of a free standing house to households earning less than R3500 per month. Evidence affirms housing as an important component of the social wage package and households  safety net.2.4. Cabinet approved the report on the Implementation Evaluation of the Funza Lushaka Bursary Programme as well as the Management Response and Improvement from the Department of Basic Education. This was part of the 2014/15 National Evaluation Plan.Cabinet approved that the Department of Basic Education retains the Programme which was established in 2007 to increase the supply of competent teachers specialising in priority areas. The Department will also consider the expansion and supplementation of the Programme.Empirical evidence shows that the design of the Programme is relevant in terms of its political, economic and social context. It is also largely appropriate in terms of the complex environment in which it is implemented. The Programme has implemented continuous improvements in its strategy, including the introduction of a district-based recruitment system in 2012. It has made an important contribution to a substantial increase in enrolment in initial teacher education2.5. Cabinet was briefed on the Disability Index Framework and approved the piloting of the Disability Inequality Index. Cabinet also supports the government-wide disaggregation of all data sets in terms of gender, disability and age.The Disability Inequality Index is a key tool for tracking inequality between persons with disabilities and persons without disabilities, and provides a strategic high level quick scan on the measurement of the inequality gap. This assists in targeting government interventions more inclusively.The process of disaggregation will enable timeous responses by government to the experiences of compounded vulnerabilities. The Policy alignments and improvements on their own, cannot reduce these inequalities, without a systematic and consistent measurement of the inequality gap.2.6. Cabinet approved the Policy for Social Service Practitioners, 2016. The overarching outcome is delivery of responsive and quality developmental social services, through the regulation of social service practitioners. This creates an enabling framework that will broaden the human resource profile of the social development sector, so as to improve the care and protection services provided to vulnerable groups.There is a need for a diverse cadres of social service practitioners including community development practitioner, care givers, and Early Childhood Development practitioners; to respond to legislative reforms, the changing needs of communities, and socio-economic conditions in the social welfare services sector.2.7.

Cabinet approved South Africa s Phase 3 Written Follow-up Country Report regarding the implementation of the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery and Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (Anti-Bribery Convention).The report outlines the concerted efforts of government to detect, investigate and prosecute foreign bribery cases. This Convention focuses on the use of domestic law to criminalise bribery of foreign officials. It applies to active and passive bribery, but excludes bribery that is purely domestic and bribery where the direct or indirect recipient of a benefit is not a public official.Phase 1 focussed on identification of legal instruments and mechanisms that countries have adopted to combat foreign bribery. Phase 2 focussed on the application and effectiveness of such instruments and mechanisms. Phase 3 sought to determine the impact of the country s adoption of the Convention. Phase 4, which commenced in 2016, is focussing on key group-wide cross-cutting issues related to enforcement efforts and changes in the domestic legislation or institutional framework of the Parties.2.9. Cabinet approved the proposed measures set out in the Business Case to reposition the Department of Home Affairs. The Department must be positioned within the security system of the state so that it contributes to national security and is able to protect its people, systems and data.This will better enable the department to deliver against its full mandate as a critical enabler of inclusive economic development, national security, effective service delivery and efficient administration.2.10. Cabinet approved that the South African Police Service release the national crime statistics report for the trimester of 2016/17.

Cabinet was briefed on the Minister of Police s intention to declare an amnesty in terms of the Firearms Control Act, 2000 (Act No 60 of 2000), for a period of six months to maximise the participation of the community, and will commence on 1 April 2017 and end on 30 September 2017.The amnesty will reduce the circulation of illegally possessed firearms which will in turn result in the reduction of contact crimes.The amnesty will focus on the following holders of firearms and/or ammunition in South Africa:a) Persons in possession of illegal firearms and/or ammunition in circulation, including those involved in one or more criminal activities; andb) Persons who inherited firearms and/ or ammunition and failed to comply with the provisions of the Firearms Controls Act.2.12. Cabinet approved the National Anti-gangsterism Strategy to address gangsterism in all its manifestations by way of an all-government approach. This is aligned to the National Development Plan to ensure that people living in South Africa feel safe at home, schools and work, and enjoy community life free of fear. This also recognises that crime and violence are not just a security issue, but have deep social and economic roots and consequences.2.13. Cabinet approved South Africa s 3rd cycle Universal Periodic Review country report, to be presented for review by the Universal Periodic Review Working Group, at the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council in May 2017.The report reflects on the progress made by South Africa in realising the human rights and fundamental freedoms contained in the Constitution.The Universal Periodic Review is a unique process which involves a review of human rights records of all 193 UN Member States once every four years.

Cabinet approved for the Draft Regulation of Agricultural Land Holdings Bill, 2017 to be published for public comment. Land Reform is necessary to unlock the potential for a dynamic, growing and employment-creating agricultural sector.Amongst others, the Bill gives effect to the establishment of the Land Commission which will ensure a transparent and more conducive regulatory environment for the generation and utilisation of policy-relevant information on ownership and usage of agricultural land.This will improve the state s ability to monitor and evaluate its compliance with the constitutional directive to ensure land tenure and related reforms, with the intent of taking measures to redress the results of past racial discrimination.This contributes to the National Development Plan s vision for rural revitalisation, inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction which also rests on creating more equitable access to land and tenure security for all South Africans.3.7.

Such a move could contribute to increased economic growth and investment as well as ensure that South Africa is an attractive venue for parties around the world to resolve their commercial disputes.4. Issues in the Environment4.1. Cabinet joins President Jacob Zuma in calling for restraint amidst tensions between some South Africans and foreign nationals. The violence which accompanied recent community protests in Tshwane is unacceptable and has no place in our democracy. The South African Police Service (SAPS) is prepared to provide a speedy response to incidents of violence and looting. Crime is our common enemy and by working together we can address the issues that concern our communities. There is however no room for acts of violence or intimidation.  No grievance can ever justify members of the community taking the law into their own hands.By acting within the law we can make our communities safer and more secure. Citizens must work with the SAPS and other law enforcement agencies to root out crime in our communities.4.2. Government notes the concerns of contracted coal transporters regarding the impact that renewable energy projects may have on the supply of coal to Eskom, which may affect jobs in their industry. Government is open to constructive engagement with the legitimate leaders of the coal trucking industry to address issues.Government must act responsibly in its energy planning to ensure sustainable and affordable energy supply.

Following the positive identification of the Fall Army Worm infestation, government led by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is continuing with the assessment of spread and damage, as well as awareness actions to provide farmers with accurate technical information and control options as well as to ensure the responsible emergency registration of agricultural chemicals.The department has also initiated a pest action group, which meets regularly to evaluate progress and results with all provincial departments of agriculture, industry members and research organisations. The South African Emergency Plant Pest Response Plan, which deals with new pest detections, is already in motion to fight Fall Army Worm. Government will continue with its engagement with the Southern African Development Community to ensure that early warnings of these biological threats are in place.4.6. Cabinet wishes commuters who were injured when two trains collided at the Rosslyn train station north of Pretoria a speedy recovery and conveys its gratitude to emergency services for their quick response in assisting the injured.

This forms part of South Africa s contribution to the continents  celebration on the transition from the Organisation of African Unity, which was established on 25 May 1963, to the current African Union, and its related institutions and programmes.The celebration of Africa Month contributes to the decolonisation of the African continent through a variety of government and civil society projects under the theme:  A Year of OR Tambo: Building a Better Africa and a Better World .Africa Month contributes to the Pan African call for African unity and co-operation, and is used as a platform by all African Union Member States to take stock of progress made towards realising Agenda 2063.The government-wide month long programme, which will be available on www.gov.za, goes beyond the arts and culture sector to embrace the contributions of the South African Government through economic, political and social factors impacting on the development of the continent. Activities and dialogues are celebratory and educational, all have political and socio-economic benefits for the people of South Africa and the rest of the continent to celebrate their Africaness and recommit to building communities grounded on positive shared African values and principles.1.4. Cabinet was briefed on the successful hosting of the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) and Institutions Annual World Library and Information Congress held in South Africa, Cape Town from 15 to 21 August 2015.The IFLA Cape Town Declaration will be submitted to the African Union Ministers of Culture for concurrence, support and implementation.

Government s commitment to bolster the economy was reaffirmed during the successful engagement between the Minister of Finance, Malusi Gigaba with investors and the global finance community during the visit to the United States of America for the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Spring Meetings. Minister Gigaba also interacted with domestic investors and the NEDLAC Special Executive Committee chaired by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa.The engagements underscored that government s policy orientation towards prudent fiscal discipline and stringent fiscal consolidation as highlighted in the 2017 National Budget will remain unchanged.Cabinet calls on all sectors to partner with government to boost confidence and propel the economy towards sustained inclusive growth.2.2. President Jacob Zuma s launch of the Maluti-A-Phofung Special Economic Zone (MAP-SEZ) in Tshiame, Harrismith, in the Eastern Free State, on 25 April 2017 demonstrates governments  promotion of industrial development which is key to the nation s long-term economic success and prosperity. The priority sectors for the MAP-SEZ are automotive, agro-processing, logistics, ICT, pharmaceuticals and general processing. This creates opportunities for manufacturing as well as a regional and international trade environment with an added value chain within the Maluti-A-Phofung Municipality.The launch of the SEZ brought the tally of Special Economic Zones in the country to eight. To date the SEZ Programme has collectively attracted over R9.5 billion worth of investments. They have also created over 10 000 direct jobs and 65 000 indirect jobs. The Special Economic Zones also continue to play a role in attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).This 1038-hectare MAP-SEZ launch forms a key part of the implementation of the Industrial Policy Action Plan which designates Special Economic Zones to accelerate local economic growth and development in specific regions of the country.2.3. Cabinet welcomes the A.T. Kearney s 2017 Foreign Direct Investment Confidence report, which indicates that South Africa is the 25th most attractive destination for foreign direct investment globally, the first from the African Continent.South Africa made a comeback into the index, which publishes the 25 most attractive investment destinations, for the first time since 2014. It ranks with other developing countries such as China (3rd), India (8th); Brazil (16th) and Mexico (17).This ranking shows that South Africa s strategic partnership with foreign investors is gaining momentum and further demonstrates that our country s blueprint on development is yielding results. Improvements in short-term economic prospects and the long-term investment in the country s manufacturing sector have been cited as some of the key drivers of South Africa s improved rating on the Index.2.4. In a separate report, the latest Africa Investment Index 2016 by Quantum Global s independent research arm ranks South Africa fourth most attractive investment destination in Africa after Botswana, Morocco and Egypt. South Africa scored well on the growth factor of GDP, ease of doing business in the country and significant population.The country s attractiveness as an investment destination of choice was further highlighted in the African Economic Outlook 2016 report, which places South Africa fourth among the leading African investment destinations in 2015 after Egypt ($10.2 billion), Mozambique ($4.7 billion) and Morocco ($4.2 billion) with $3.6 billion in foreign investment. South Africa continues to build on its strong financial and business base, ranking 47th out of 138 countries in the World Economic Forum Global Competitive Index 2016/17.2.5. The 27th World Economic Forum on Africa will take place at the Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre in Durban from 3 to 5 May 2017 under the theme:  Achieving Inclusive Growth: Responsive and Responsible Leadership. Cabinet welcomes this opportunity for South Africans to engage in dialogue on potential investment opportunities, deeper regional integration and a renewed commitment towards sustainable growth and development in Africa.Africa is home to some of the world s fastest growing economies which have attracted increasing interest from global investors. South Africa is the most diversified economy on the continent and plays an integral role in Africa s advancement.2.6. The commitment by South Africa and Oman to enhance trade relations, at a business forum on 27 March 2017 between Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies and his Omani counterpart, Dr Ali Bin Masoud Al-Sunaidy, enables South African businesspeople to take advantage of the opportunities that Oman presents, particularly for agricultural and agro-processing industries.Further, the Department of Trade and Industry s investment mission to Ghana and Nigeria between the 20 and 25 March 2017 contributed to identifying and creating export markets for South African value-added products and services. It also promotes South African products, service offerings and creates business partnerships between business communities of the respective countries.Increasing trade on the continent and fostering partnerships with African partners can lead to poverty alleviation, increased trade flows, industrial development and subsequent creation of more jobs, which is key to the economic development of Africa.2.7. The Minister of Small Business Development, Lindiwe Zulu led the South African delegation at the Estonia business forum which was hosted by the South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry. With Estonia s economy consisting of 90 per cent SMMEs, South Africa s partnership bolsters government s commitment to job creation and the promotion of small, medium-sized and micro enterprises (SMMEs).2.8. The resilience of our farming sector supported by early warning systems and research, notwithstanding the Fall Army Worm infestation and the drought, was demonstrated by the 2017 estimated commercial maize crop size, which is 84% bigger than the 2016 crop, which was the smallest crop since 2007. The three main maize producing areas, namely the Free State, Mpumalanga and North West provinces are expected to produce 82% of the 2017 crop.The size of the expected commercial maize crop has been set at 14,324 mill. tons, this is 2,91% (405 050 tons) more than the previous forecast of 13,918 mill. tons.  The area estimate for maize remains at 2,629 mill. ha, while the expected yield is 5,45 t/ha.2.9. Governments  commitment to strengthening, developing, and broadening access to universities, is demonstrated in the doubling of student numbers over the past 20 years. This was bolstered by the Minister of Higher Education and Training, Dr Blade Nzimande s announcement of government spending to the tune of R 7-billion over the next two years on new student housing, laboratories, communications technology, and other essential facilities, as well as essential maintenance and the further expansion of the new universities. A further R2,5-billion over the next five years will target historically disadvantaged universities so as to better enable them to realise their full academic potential.Investment in infrastructure, including teaching and research spaces, equipment, and conducive student living environments is key to ensuring that the universities can deliver on their empowerment mandate.2.10. The Minister of Labour, Mildred Oliphant will lead the national 2017 Workers Month awareness campaign under the theme  Know your rights and responsibilities as a means to promote greater compliance .The campaign will raise awareness levels amongst workers in South Africa about their rights and responsibilities. It will also highlight the achievements of workers in South Africa and assess compliance with labour laws. The Month will include surprise inspections in sectors that are considered perpetual offenders.  Government has passed legislation to deal with the gross inequalities and unfair discrimination which we inherited.  At the centre of our labour laws is the quest to advance economic development, social justice, labour peace and the democratisation of the work place. Cabinet calls on all sectors and to do their part in addressing the inequalities of the past by addressing the slow pace of transformation in the workplace.2.11. Government embarked on the 6th National Imbizo Focus Week of the current administration from 17 to 23 April 2017.

Issues in the Environment3.1. President Jacob Zuma led the 23rd national Freedom Day celebrations on 27 April 2017 under the theme  The year of OR Tambo: Together deepening democracy and building safer and crime-free communities .The President s engagement in Manguzi, Umhlabuyalingana forms part of a national anti-crime campaign, which is also a follow-up to the Presidential Siyahlola Monitoring Programme in March 2017. It highlights the need for urgent action to address cross-border crime especially car hijackings. Government is hard at work in the area to eradicate crime and to address issues from the Umhlabuyalingana community, including challenges around the Isimangaliso Wetland Park.The celebrations reflect on the country s achievements since 1994 while mindful of the work that still needs to be done in building a truly united, non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and prosperous South Africa. In Freedom month we celebrate the contribution to our freedom and democracy, of former ANC President and national hero, Oliver Reginald Tambo, who would have turned 100 years old this year had he lived.3.2. As part of the Freedom Month programme the Minister of Communications, Ayanda Dlodlo, initiated a youth dialogue as part of on-going discussions with youth on what it means to them to  OWN YOUR FREEDOM , the tag used to follow the discussion on social media.Cabinet calls on youth to exercise their rights and responsibilities prudently and to respect those who fought for our freedom, that it being enjoyed by all in our democratic country.3.3. Cabinet welcomes the first meeting of the South Africa-China high level People-to-People Exchange Mechanism (PPEM) which took place from 24 to 27 April.

The IMC on the People-to-People Exchange Mechanism, led by Minister Nathi Mthethwa hosted Vice Premier Lui Yandong and delegates from the People s Republic of China.A range of cooperation agreements were signed falling within the two broad themes   Human Capital Development, and Research and Development.

Other areas for enhanced cooperation include: culture; communications; health; science and technology; sports; tourism; women affairs and youth.3.4. Cabinet conveys its condolences to the families and friends of the 235 people who lost their lives due to road accidents over the Easter holiday. The statistics for the period indicate that 50 per cent of the people who died were pedestrians, followed by passengers at 24 per cent and drivers at 19 per cent.3.5. Cabinet also joins President Jacob Zuma in expressing deep sadness and shock at the passing of 18 school pupils, and two adults during a horrific minibus taxi accident in Bronkhorstspruit, outside Pretoria. We echo the call by President Zuma for law enforcement agencies to swiftly investigate the cause of the accident.  Cabinet thanks all government departments, NGOs, professionals and businesses who are supporting the affected families as well as learners and staff members from Mahlenga High School and Refano Primary School during this difficult period.The road carnage, particularly during holidays in South Africa, remains a pressing national concern. In many cases these fatalities could have been prevented through responsible behaviour and use of the country s roads. Reckless and negligent driving are unacceptable and all South Africans are urged to take personal responsibility for their safety on our roads.3.6. Cabinet commends the bus transport sector for returning to work after a violence free strike, showing the way for industrial protests. The Minister of Labour s role must be acknowledged in facilitating the end of the strike for this very important sector of our economy.3.7. Cabinet is concerned by the recent upswing in violence in Vuwani following the decision by the Municipal Demarcation Board to incorporate it into a new municipality.Cabinet strongly condemns the use of our children as a negotiation tool, the weeks of school shutdown dampens the future of these children who are placed under additional stress. Violence, intimidation, vandalism, or actions that lead to schools being destroyed or learners deprived from going to school has no place in our democracy.Cabinet acknowledges the work done by the Inter Ministerial Committee, led by the Minister of Cooperative Government and Traditional Affairs Mr Des Van Rooyen and the visit by Safety and Security Minister, Fikile Mbalula, and endorses the view that criminal activities including damage and destruction of property will not be tolerated.  President Jacob Zuma is scheduled to meet with VhaVenda King Toni Mphephu Ramabulana and traditional leaders from Vhembe district in a bid to bring stability. Cabinet emphasises that money and resources spent on replacing damaged schools was meant for other programmes.3.8.

The new Metrorail (People's) trains are part of the new fleet that will be rolled out by government over the next 10 to 15 years as part of PRASA s Modernization Programme.

South Africa, as part of the global community that is aligned with fighting illegal financial activities, will be aligned to the international intervention that seeks to fight money laundering and financing of terrorism.5.2. This Bill will also contribute to strengthening the transparency and integrity of the South African financial system and make it harder for criminals involved in tax evasion, money laundering and illicit financial flows to hide using the South African financial systems. It forms part of the number of instruments we have as a country to fight white-collar crime in both the private and public sectors.5.3. Cabinet was apprised by the Minister of Finance that consultations are ongoing and will be finalised soon so as to ensure the process of promulgating the regulations that will effect the Financial Intelligence Centre Act.6. Cabinet decisions6.1. The Minister of Finance briefed Cabinet on the recent International Monetary Fund/World Bank Spring meetings, Investor Roadshow and the WEF on Africa meetings.

Transport plays a key role in enabling global trade in an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable manner. Transport systems form the backbone of South Africa s socio-economic activities by enabling the movement of people and goods.

The strategy seeks to propose interventions that will reduce GHG emissions within the sustainable development principles.6.8. Cabinet approved that South Africa joins the Smart Africa Alliance. This is an African-led collaboration focusing on developing relevant solutions and sharing resources to address the development challenges facing the continent. It places Information and Communications Technologies at the centre of the Development Agenda 2063 of African countries.South Africa will benefit both economically and politically through its participation in Smart Africa.By positioning the South African industry and expertise at the heart of Smart Africa s development agenda, South Africa will contribute to the growth of local business in the region.6.9.

The 1999 policy focused on universal precautions and biomedical aspects of prevention, and less on the structural, social and behavioral drivers of HIV.This policy proposes a paradigm shift towards approaching HIV as a core management issue using a public-health approach, as well as the inclusion of TB as a priority within schools, amongst others. The scope of application is widened to learners, educators and officials, in public as well as independent schools.7. Bills7.1. Cabinet approved the introduction of the Airports Company Amendment Bill, 2017 and the Air Traffic and Navigation Services Amendment Bill to Parliament. Amendments in these two Bills seek to provide for a permanent regulatory structure. They also provide for the setting up of appeal mechanism committees, which will serve to resolve disputes.8. Upcoming events       8.1.

During this period of the Tourism Indaba, South Africa will benefit from the number of delegates that will be visiting our country.8.2. The Minister of Energy, Ms Mmamoloko Kubayi, will this month lead the Energy Month campaign under the theme:  Promoting affordable and sustainable energy mix in support of radical socio-economic transformation . The campaign will educate, create awareness and engage the public on energy efficiency, energy security, alternative energy matters and how they are all central to household, commercial and industrial consumption.8.3.

They will use these submissions to also share with the public what their programmes will entail for the current financial year.  Cabinet calls on the public to engage with these presentations as they are presented through the parliamentary process.  8.4.

A total 1 371 members of the SANDF are deployed in the DRC in support of the United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission. Their deployment has been extended from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018.9.3. Our deployments on the continent are in continued support of regional and continental processes to respond to and resolve crises, promote peace and security, strengthen regional integration, significantly increase intra-African trade and champion sustainable development in Africa.10. National Orders         10.1. Cabinet congratulates all the recipients of the 2017 National Orders. In the year of OR Tambo they have shown us the power of working towards a better South Africa and better nation.

The release of the 17th Commission for Employment Equity Report by the Minster of Labour, Ms Mildred Oliphant, shows the stubbornly slow pace of transformation at various workplaces in the South African labour market. The report demonstrates that we are still far from achieving a workforce that is truly representative of our nation. African people, women and persons with disabilities remain severely under-represented in all aspects of the Employment Equity.10.3. The report showed that white people occupied 68% of the country s top-management positions in the public and private sectors, six times the group s economically active population. Africans made up only 14.4% of top management.10.4. Given the urgent need to transform the economy and ensure inclusive growth, this is simply not good enough.

Issues in the environment1.1 Cabinet is concerned with the rising incidences of abuse and violence against women in our society. Recent incidents involving intimate partner violence have seen many brave and courageous women speaking out against this violation of their rights.1.2 Cabinet acknowledges that as a country we continue to have a patriarchal society and as such calls for more to be done to fight the scourge of femicide and human trafficking.1.3 Cabinet calls on all sectors of society to join hands in defeating this scourge, oppose any form of violence committed against women and children, and work with the police and justice system in order to bring perpetrators to justice. 1.4 President Jacob Zuma has called for a stop to the continued abuse of women and children. Cabinet has instructed the Social Protection, Community and Human Development Cluster to put in place a programme of action that will drive the country in the fight to stop the abuse of women and children.1.5 Cabinet welcomes the results of the 2016 South African Demographic and Health Survey by Statistics South Africa, which measures the health status of South Africans, and the reach and quality of health programmes. The survey amongst others reports a 20% drop in infant mortality and a 11% drop in the number of women and men who smoke tobacco.The results demonstrate that the policy interventions that were put in place by President Zuma s administration are yielding positive results.Cabinet, however, is concerned about the number of South Africans that still continues to engage in unprotected sex with multiple partners. Some 32% and 42% of women and men respectively indicated that they have never been tested for HIV despite government efforts to raise awareness on HIV testing.Cabinet calls on all South Africans to take personal responsibility for their health and well-being, practice safe sex and get tested regularly for HIV and all communicable and non-communicable diseases.1.6 Cabinet calls on parents and guardians to ensure their children are vaccinated against childhood diseases. Cabinet remains committed to ensuring children are immunised to eliminate life threatening infectious diseases. Cabinet reassures parents and guardians that the drugs administered by the Department Health are safe.1.7 Cabinet welcomed the first phase of the revitalised Vulindlela Heights Industrial in Mthatha in the Eastern Cape. This is part of the country s Revitalisation of Industrial Parks Programme. It is the second of its kind in the Eastern Cape and one of six parks being revitalised across the country.Government is revitalising industrial parks to boost job creation and ensure inclusive growth. The move of economic activities away from urban centres is also part of government s economic transformation efforts.Information on how to take advantage of opportunities available at our industrial parks, access government support and incentives programmes, and investment opportunities in various sectors is available at www.thedti.gov.za or through the Department of Trade and Industry s (the dti) Customer Contact Centre on 0861 843 384.1.8 Cabinet has noted with regret the decision by General Motors South Africa (GMSA) (Pty) Ltd to phase out the manufacturing and sale of Chevrolet vehicles in the country.This holds dire consequences for those who will lose their job and for our economy.   Government remains committed to support the country s automotive sector, which is critical for the economy and job creation.The dti continues to work with all stakeholders to mitigate the impact. To increase manufacturing, employment creation and export intensity, we recently launched the ninth phase of the Industrial Policy Action Plan (IPAP) to guide our actions. Cabinet notes that Isuzu, which has been partnering with GMSA over the years in South Africa, will take over the operations from GMSA.1.9 Cabinet has noted the deterioration of the drought situation in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape. Cabinet calls on the communities to support the water restrictions introduced by the provinces. A team comprising officials from the Department of Water and Sanitation, the National Disaster Management Committee working with the provinces and local government, had been actively engaged in ensuring that short to medium-term solutions are fast-tracked to guarantee the water security of the province in the long term.Cabinet calls on all South Africans including domestic users, businesses, mining sector, energy and agriculture to work together and use water more sparingly1.10 Cabinet welcomed the released Anti-Corruption Strategy discussion document, which will inform the National Anti-Corruption Strategy. Cabinet invites the public to make written inputs through the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation website: www.dpme.gov.za.The fight against corruption remains one of the main priorities for government. Corruption and integrity failures in both the private and public sector have a detrimental effect on our country s development.1.11 Cabinet expressed concern at the recent global cyber-attack, which has been reported as the biggest cyber-attack to date.Cabinet urges all South Africans to take the necessary precautions when using electronic means of communicating or transacting. The use of updated antivirus software which scans the environment frequently is also recommended.1.12 Cabinet is concerned about the recent developments at Eskom. Cabinet appreciates that the matter regarding the re-employment of Mr Brian Molefe as the Chief Executive Officer of Eskom is before courts and in Parliament, and shall therefore respect these processes. The President has, however, set up an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) comprising the Ministers of Public Enterprises, Energy, Finance and Justice and Correctional Services. The IMC is asked to gather the facts in order to guide Cabinet on how to deal with such matters in future. The convenor is the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, Mr Michael Masutha.2.

The allocation of spectrum by the World Radiocommunication Conference has a significant impact on the economic growth of South Africa.The National Radio Frequency Plan 2017 is a comprehensive source of radio frequency spectrum allocation for different radiocommunication services. The revised National Radio Frequency Plan 2017 ensures South Africa is aligned with the approved International Radio Regulations that were adopted in the 2015 International Telecommunication Union conference.2.3 Cabinet approved the Inland Waterways Safety Strategy. The strategy, through the South African Maritime Safety Authority, sets standards and enhances procedures for permitting and licensing arrangements for boats operating on inland waterways. This will ensure the safety of small vessels on South Africa s inland waterways.2.4 Cabinet approved the Road Freight Strategy. The strategy aims to create an integrated regulatory and operational framework, which will enable South Africa to achieve best international standards of road-freight operations.The recommendations in this strategy will enhance the efficiency of enforcement, promote road safety, improve the protection of the infrastructure, reduce environmental impacts, and create an integrated framework of quality-regulated competition within which the road freight sector can continue to serve the needs of the South African economy.2.5 Cabinet approved the South African Mint Company s designs for the 2017 and 2018 numismatic commemorative and circulation coins.In collaboration with Cabinet, a new series was developed that represents culture, freedom and democracy under the theme:  Celebrating South Africa .

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 7 June 2017,8 Jun 2017,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-7-june-2017-8-jun-2017-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-7-june-2017-8-jun-2017-0000,"1. Issues in the Environment1.1. Cabinet reiterates President Jacob Zuma s call for South Africans to unite against violence and abuse of women and children, and calls on all South Africans to take urgent steps to eradicate this scourge in our communities. This follows the President s visit to Elsies River in Cape Town in support of the Fight against Crime Imbizo. This visit once again highlighted the vulnerability of women and children in our society.The President undertook to return to the area to look into the many challenges of crime and murder, especially of children and how law-enforcement authorities would improve their services to the community.1.2. Cabinet welcomes the release of the General Household Survey 2016, which continues to show progress in the implementation of government programmes to improve the lives of South Africans, especially the previously disadvantaged communities. The statistics show that government is making inroads in providing housing, with South African households living in  RDP  or state-subsidised dwellings increasing from 5% in 2002 to 13, 5% in 2016. The survey also shows that government s social-assistance programmes indicates an increase from 12, 7% in 2003 to 29,7% in 2016.There is also a marked increase in access to water, electricity and sanitation, which is an important marker for the South African Government s ambition to redress the wrongs of apartheid and provide basic services to all the people.Cabinet has, however, noted that while higher education enrolments are on the increase, albeit at a slow pace, only 3, 3% of black Africans aged 18 to 29 years were studying as opposed to 18, 8% of Indian/Asian individuals and 17, 5% of the white population in this age group. Only 3, 5% of the coloured population was studying during 2016.The survey further indicated a decrease from 23, 8% to 11, and 8% of households that experienced hunger, which shows progress in addressing communities living in extreme poverty.1.3. Cabinet noted the Quarterly Labour Force Survey for the first quarter of the year that showed the economy adding 144 000 jobs. These numbers were offset by an increase in the number of job-seekers by 433 00 people. Cabinet reaffirms its commitment to continue partnering with the private sector and labour in its attempts to address the country s unemployment challenges.1.4. Cabinet welcomes the launch of the refurbished Babelegi Industrial Park in Hammanskraal as part of government s plans to accelerate economic development and job creation in the area. The R42-million project is part of government s Revitalisation of Industrial Parks Programme and one of six parks that are being revitalised across the country for broader economic and industrial development.Cabinet encourages local industries and businesses to consider expanding operations to industrial parks to access the various support measures which are available to further develop their businesses.1.5. Cabinet was briefed by Minister of Finance, Mr Malusi Gigaba, on the latest South Africa s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures, which contracted  by 0,7% in the first quarter of 2017. This worse-than-expected GDP outcome is significantly lower than the 2017 Budget Review, which projected 2017 GDP growth at 1, 3%. This has been attributed to, among other things, the contraction of the manufacturing, trade, catering and accommodation industries.The economy was nevertheless supported by growth in the mining and quarrying industry which increased 12.8%. The agriculture, forestry and fishing industry rebounded in the first quarter of 2017 with an increase of 22, 2%.There are green shoots that the country can leverage to boost its own economic growth outlook. These include improving global growth, stabilising commodity prices, more favourable climate conditions, reliable electricity supply and less volatile labour relations.As a matter of urgency, Cabinet calls on business, labour and the broader society to partner with government to intensify our growth programme and improve confidence so as to arrest the decline and set the economy on a higher trajectory, to achieve inclusive economic growth. In this regard the Minister of Finance will meet with business leaders in a bid to formulate strategies to counter economic recession and achieve inclusive growth.Cabinet endorsed a full media briefing by the Minister of Finance to share with South Africans the interventions government will embark upon within the current budget framework. Cabinet further reaffirms the adopted budget framework for the country.1.6. The rating agencies Fitch and Standard & Poor s affirmed South Africa s long-term foreign currency debt ratings of  BB+ .This comes amid Minister Gigaba s engagements with the private sector to ensure that the joint work of government, business, labour and civil society continues, and that the pledges made are fulfilled.Cabinet reiterates that South Africans must continue to act in unison, especially during difficult times and work even harder to ensure that the country reclaims its investment grade status.1.7. Cabinet welcomes deliberations at the inaugural Joint Administration Committee for the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) and the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU) recently held in the country.The parties agreed to jointly consider opportunities to promote the MERCOSUR-SACU Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) by including their trade promotion agencies, chambers of commerce, private sector, and their respective embassies and foreign missions. The MERCOSUR-SACU agreement provides local exporters with the opportunity to tap into a market of more than 280-million people.Cabinet calls on all the country s exporters to take advantage of the PTA as local products are now able to enter the MERCOSUR bloc at preferential duty rates.1.8. Cabinet expressed regret at the decision of the United States of America (USA) to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.The Paris Agreement, which will be fully operational by 2020, is premised on contributions determined by countries themselves towards collectively agreed global goals.South Africa has called on the USA to reconsider its position and recommit to the multilateral process.1.9. The Memorandum of Understanding between Novartis, the South African Medical Research Council and the Department of Science and Technology, paves the way to boost the volume and quality of clinical trials and build research capability on the continent.The agreement will allow for joint research programmes in selected communicable and non-communicable diseases, improve South African patients' access to innovative medicines, and build the country and continent's research and development capabilities.Cabinet believes that there is room for more public-private partnerships, and is convinced that these can lead the way in addressing the many pressing challenges we face.   1.10. Cabinet welcomes the 2017 Report from the International Congress and Convention Association, which continues to rank South Africa as the top business events destination in Africa and the Middle East. The report was released in May 2017 in Frankfurt, Germany.South Africa remains one of the world s most popular tourist destinations and continues to top the rankings also on the World Economic Forum Travel s global travel and tourism competitiveness index as released in April 2017.Cabinet would like to see more of South Africa s smaller towns and cities bidding for smaller meetings where they can meet the hosting requirements. This will help to improve the geographic distribution of tourism beyond the major centres and spread the wealth generated by these events more equitably.1.11. Cabinet calls on South Africans to be vigilant of fake news, in particular the increase in false posts on social media over missing, kidnapped and abducted girls and women. The recent outbreak of violence in KwaMashu, near Durban over fake reports of children being abducted in the area and the alleged abduction of a girl in Naledi, Soweto by persons in a Toyota Quantum with registration number included went viral on social media, which was later found to be untrue.These hoaxes, fake news and the dissemination of false information cause panic among our communities and waste time and resources of the police. We appeal to people not to repost and disseminate fake news on social media, until they have verified the authenticity.1.12. Cabinet has noted with serious concern the media reports on the  leaked emails  that are purported to implicate Ministers, officials and private individuals in alleged wrongdoing.Cabinet remains fully committed to good governance and at the same time, it also notes that all persons are presumed innocent until proven guilty in terms of our Constitution.Cabinet urges all who have information about any wrongdoing by government officials or Ministers to inform the law-enforcement agencies so that investigations can be undertaken.It is aware that some cases have already been opened, and the police are undertaking the necessary investigations. All who are affected by the emails are urged to cooperate with the law-enforcement agencies.President Zuma has rebutted the allegation that was published by a Sunday newspaper that he owns a house in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.2. Cabinet decisions2.1. Cabinet was apprised of the 4th performance quarterly progress reports for 2016/17 (January-March 2017) on the implementation of priority outcomes.Cabinet s oversight over the implementation of the Medium Term Strategic Framework 2014 to 2019, results in improved service delivery.

The theme offers opportunities to scrutinise on how the Public Service defines and responds to a citizen-centred service delivery culture that is defined by the way things are currently done.4. Condolences4.1. Cabinet extends its condolences to the family and friends of the commuter who died when two Metrorail trains collided near the Elandsfontein station in Ekurhuleni and wishes a speedy recovery to those injured in the accident.Cabinet calls for the investigation into the root cause of the accident to be fast-tracked to prevent a recurrence of such fatal accidents.4.2.

The attack, which took place on the night of 3 June 2017 in the City of London, claimed the lives of several people and left others injured.The attack in London occurred within a fortnight of the one in Manchester, where many civilians, mainly youth and children, lost their lives.Cabinet extended its condolences to the government and people of the UK, in particular the families and loved ones of the deceased, and wished the injured a speedy recovery.4.3.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 21 June 2017,22 Jun 2017,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-21-june-2017-22-jun-2017-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-21-june-2017-22-jun-2017-0000,"Cabinet met on Wednesday, 21 June 2017, at Tuynhuys, Cape Town.1.  Issues in the environment1.1. Cabinet reflected on the recent announcements by the three major ratings agencies. All three ratings agencies raised similar issues such as the slow pace of growth-enhancing reforms, the performance of state-owned companies (SOCs) and political risks, among other issues.Cabinet expressed confidence in its systematic interventions to address the country s economic challenges as well as work undertaken to strengthen the performance of the SOCs.  Government remains on track in maintaining its fiscal framework, ensuring policy certainty, and working to ensure inclusive growth and economic transformation.Cabinet reiterates that the foundation for a higher growth path and socio-economic development has already been laid.It focuses on improving investor and consumer confidence by fast-tracking the implementation of the structural reforms for economic growth.President Jacob Zuma convened the Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) Advisory Council workshop on Tuesday, 20 June 2017, which focused on radical socio-economic transformation.The workshop, amongst others, addressed the systematic and structural implementation challenges of the Broad-Based BEE Act, 2003 (Act 53 of 2003) and the proposed recommendations to realise government s objectives on radical socio-economic transformation.The partnership between government, business, labour and civil society is critical to boost confidence levels, so that working together we can reclaim and maintain investment-grade ratings.1.2. As Youth Month draws to a close, Cabinet thanks all sectors who participated in activities across the country. The participation of thousands of young people in the various Youth Month empowerment activities that were hosted by departments, government entities and the private sector is encouraging.This year marks the 41st anniversary of the 1976 Soweto Student Uprising and the commemoration serves as a reminder that young people in the country were at the forefront of our Struggle.Cabinet calls on youth to use all the support and resources that government has made available to improve their prospects and advance their participation in the economy.1.3. Cabinet condemns the recent violence and intimidation of commuters during the protests by taxi owners. Such actions are out of place in a democratic society. Peaceful interventions on any matter will always be beneficial to all parties involved.The subsequent agreement between the South African National Taxi Association and SA Taxi Finance Holdings is further confirmation that peaceful dialogue can resolve such issues without impacting on innocent people and disrupting the economy.Cabinet welcomes this decision, which is in the best interest of commuters and the taxi industry.Cabinet welcomes the dialogue currently taking place between the Department of Transport and the leadership of the taxi industry in finding a lasting solution. The department will be engaging development finance institutions to seek alternative taxi finance options. 1.4. Cabinet conveys its deepest sympathy to all who lost loved ones during the recent disasters in the Western and Eastern Cape respectively. A number of residents also suffered displacement and loss of property.Cabinet commends the prompt integrated approach and response from government, business and ordinary South Africans in assisting the affected families. Cabinet pays tribute to the heroic volunteer firefighter, Bradley Richards and the truck driver John Blaaw who assisted firefighters in transporting water who paid with their lives saving their community. Cabinet further extends a special appreciation to the Working on Fire team that bravely fought the raging fires. They are our pride! Cabinet wishes a speedy recovery to the two injured firefighters including Ian Barnard who sustained injuries whilst trying to save Bradley Richards.                                                 President Zuma visited the communities of Wit Lokasie and Knysna Heights that were adversely affected by the fires. President Zuma attended the memorial service of Mr Richards. In the true firefighter team spirit, Mr Barnard was able to attend the memorial service of his colleague Mr Richards. The President dispatched humanitarian and other support to all the affected areas. This was coordinated through the National Joint Operations Centre Disaster Management structure, working with the Western Cape Provincial Government and Provincial Disaster Management teams.Cabinet thanks all non-governmental organisations, the private sector, volunteers and communities who are supporting affected communities.1.5. Cabinet urges communities in Limpopo bordering Zimbabwe to be vigilant and exercise caution with their chicken stock. This follows a report of an outbreak of a bird and chicken flu virus called H5N8.The trade in birds and chicken products from Zimbabwe has been suspended. The H5N8 virus is highly pathogenic and extremely contagious, and leads to a high level of mortality. Commercial farmers are also encouraged to increase their biosecurity measures on farms.1.6.  Cabinet has welcomed the High Court ruling that declared Section 18 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977 (Act 51 of 1977) unconstitutional, lifting the 20-year limit to lay criminal charges against those accused of sexual abuse. This ruling will go a long way in strengthening our justice system s capacity to act against those perpetrating violence against women and children.1.7. Cabinet welcomes the recent Internet for All community session held in Kliptown, Soweto. The session   led by Telecommunications and Postal Services Minister Siyabonga Cwele, in partnership with the World Economic Forum, private sector and civil society   resulted in the training of about 500 young people in basic information and communications technology (ICT) skills. The Declaration on Internet for All adopted the leadership structure and also identified targets for implementation within the next six months.Cabinet further welcomed the intervention by the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services through the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa and the Economic Development Department through the Competition Commission, to look into the high data costs that continue to be an inhibition to increase access to ICTs.1.8. Cabinet is concerned by reports of services being disrupted at mortuaries in Gauteng due to ongoing labour disputes. As a result, grieving families are unable to claim their relatives  bodies.Death in any family brings an element of vulnerability and pain to the surviving family members. As society no amount of dispute is worth such insensitivity. Cabinet appeals to all parties involved to find an amicable solution to their disputes without affecting the families of the deceased.1.9. Cabinet welcomes the formation of the Local Government Youth Development Forum. The forum is set to be a progressive voice of youth in the implementation of various youth development initiatives within local government.  The Forum held its first inaugural conference on the 20 -21 June in Muldersdrift, west of Johannesburg.2.  Cabinet decisions2.1.

Cabinet approved that South Africa submits its bid to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup (RWC). This will once again afford South Africa an opportunity to showcase the country to the international community. South Africa has previously hosted world-class events such as the All Africa Games, Cricket World Cup, 2010 FIFA World Cup and many international conferences. As the country we have learnt from these past experiences particularly the costs overruns and collusion which accompanied 2010. As a result of this, government refused to sign an open-ended blank cheque  which led to South Africa withdrawing its bid to host the Common wealth GamesCabinet was apprised on the spin-offs from such an event. South Africa already has the requisite infrastructure to host the tournament without allocating a budget for infrastructure development. Sports is said to be one of the most effective drivers of nation-building and the rugby sports programmes would enhance social cohesion. The programmes to be rolled out throughout the country leading to 2023 will leave a lasting legacy for the development of rugby in underprivileged communities.Cabinet has approved the overall proposed package for this tournament which is an economic bid which would minimise  the demands on the fiscus as well as stimulate economic activity employment and empowermentThe tournament will contribute to stimulating our economy by supporting government priorities, especially as it relates to preferential procurement and adherence to the Sport Transformation Charter and the sharing of the profits derived.

Cabinet approved the Draft Intellectual Property (IP) Policy of South Africa   Phase I (2017) for publication in the Government Gazette for public comments.This responds to the National Development Plan s call for greater emphasis on innovation, improved productivity, more intense pursuit of a knowledge economy, and better exploitation of comparative and competitive advantages.The IP Policy is an important policy instrument in promoting innovation, technology transfer, research and development, creative expression, consumer protection, industrial development and more broadly, economic growth.1.5. Cabinet approved the Draft Green Transport Strategy to be published for public comments. This strategy will form the cornerstone of policy development within the transport sector regarding the lowering of the GHG emissions. The aim of this strategy is to minimize the adverse impact of transport on the environment while addressing current and future transport demands based on sustainable development principles.Transport systems form the backbone of South Africa s socio-economic activities by enabling the movement of people and goods. However, emissions from the transport sector account for 10.8% of the country s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with road transport being responsible for 91.2% of these GHG emissions.

Statement on the Cabinet meeting of 16 August 2017,17 Aug 2017,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-16-august-2017-17-aug-2017-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-16-august-2017-17-aug-2017-0000,"Cabinet met at the Union Buildings in Pretoria.1. Issues in the environment1.1. As we celebrate Women's Month, Cabinet wishes Ms Getrude Shope well in her 92th birthday. MmaShope, as she is affectionately known, is a doyen of the struggle for liberation and for women emancipation in particular. She is a recipient of Isithwalandwe/Seaparankwe, the highest honour awarded by the African National Congress to those who made an outstanding contribution and sacrifice to the liberation struggle.Cabinet also extended its well wishes to Ms Zondeni Veronica Sobukwe on her 90th birthday. South Africa is a better country through the sacrifices played by women of her ilk.As the country celebrates Women's Month under the theme  The Year of OR Tambo: Women United in Moving South Africa Forward , Cabinet joins all South Africans in honouring the brave women who marched to the Union Buildings in 1956 to protest the pass laws.In the spirit of OR Tambo s  Flowers of the Revolution  statement, we commemorate the role of women as pioneers of the women's movement in this country, recognising that when you empower a woman, you empower the nation.As a country we have achieved a lot in the field of women empowerment. Prior to 1994 Parliament had a mere 2,7% representation of women, and following the first democratic elections, women representation in the National Assembly stood at 27,7%. In 1999 that figure increased to 30% and then to 32,7% in 2004. After the 2009 national elections women representation reached 42%. Women Ministries now comprise 43% of the Cabinet.We have many women in leadership positions and government structures are in place to improve the status of women. We now have the Ministry of Women  in The Presidency.1.2. South Africans across the board have worked very well to participate in this commemoration. Government s progressive policies continue to prioritise the empowerment of women, particularly those living in rural areas, who often bear the harsh realities of poverty.1.3. As we celebrate the progress we have made in the emancipation of women, Cabinet reminds the country of one of the woman anti-apartheid activists who was killed on this day in 1982. Ruth First was brutally killed by a letter bomb sent to her in Mozambique. She paid the ultimate sacrifice in her relentless pursuit of freedom for the people of South Africa.1.4. Cabinet has added its voice to the condemnation of a video showing a schoolgirl being attacked by a male pupil at a school in KwaZulu-Natal and welcomes the arrest of the suspect. The recent killing of a school teacher shot in front of her pupils by her partner reminds us of the challenges we still face of the abuse of women.Gender-based violence1.5. The harms and dangers of patriarchy which result in the violence against women and children should be fought by all of us as a society. The law-enforcement agencies and the criminal justice system must deal decisively against the perpetrators.SADC Summit1.6. South Africa, as incoming chair of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), is hosting the 37th Ordinary SADC Summit of Heads of State and Government from 9 to 20 August 2017 under the theme:  Partnering with the Private Sector in Developing Industry and Regional Value Chains .South Africa will use its position to strategically advance the country s national interests as outlined in the National Development Plan (NDP), drive regional and continental industrialisation and integration to boost the implementation of Africa Agenda 2063 of the African Union (AU). Agenda 2063 is the strategic framework for the socio-economic transformation of the continent over the next 50 years. It builds on and seeks to accelerate the implementation of past and existing continental initiatives for growth and sustainable development.Three potential growth paths, namely agro-processing, mineral beneficiation and downstream processing value chains, have been identified.The summit will also pay tribute to the outgoing President Jos  Eduardo dos Santos of Angola, who will be stepping down after 37 years as President and leading his country out of a protracted civil war.1.7. Deputy President Ramaphosa, in his capacity as the SADC Facilitator to the Kingdom of Lesotho, will also table a report to the SADC Double Troika Summit taking place in Pretoria on 18 August, where the Lesotho Government is also expected to table a reforms roadmap. This follows the consultations between the Deputy President with the new government, leaders of opposition parties, the college of chiefs and civil society stakeholders in the Kingdom, charting the path for the full implementation of SADC decisions on constitutional and security sector reforms.1.8. Cabinet welcomes the outcomes from President Jacob Zuma hosting President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of the Republic of Liberia, during a State Visit. Both countries agreed to look into improving an enabling environment to ease the manner of doing business in our respective countries. Cabinet encourages more private sector companies to invest in Liberia.The parties also agreed to finalise the signing of a Visa Waiver Agreement for Holders of Diplomatic and Official Passports. They also agreed to speed up discussions and finalisation of other bilateral instruments on agriculture, tourism, health, energy water and sanitation amongst others.1.9. Cabinet congratulates the people of Rwanda on the holding of a peaceful election that saw the re-election of President Paul Kagame. The conclusion of yet another successful poll in Africa is a clear indication that democratic advances continue across the continent.1.10. Cabinet also joined the AU in congratulating Kenya for conducting successful elections. It is now incumbent on all citizens in Kenya to accept the results of the elections and to work towards national unity in the country.BRICS1.11 President Zuma will today, 17 August 2017, preside over the official launch of the African Regional Centre of the Brazil, Russia,India, China and South Africa (BRICS) New Development Bank (NDB) at the Michelangelo Hotel, Sandton. The launch of the African Regional Centre will showcase the NDB s service offering, highlighting the bank s potential role in the area of infrastructure and sustainable development in emerging and developing countries.1.12. South Africa is among the BRICS member countries that adopted a Seven-Point Action Plan focused on expanding industrial cooperation, at a BRICS Industry Ministers meeting held in Hangzhou, China. These countries will further cooperate in fields such as the development of new industrial infrastructure, technology development and innovation, and small and medium-sized enterprises.1.13. Communication Ministers from the BRICS group also participated in a round-table, with the group publishing a Ministerial Declaration on Information Technology, that BRICS nations will step up cooperation on information security, as digital communication technology plays an increasingly important role in driving economic growth.1.14. Cabinet thanks the former Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Mr Tito Mboweni, for his professionalism and dedication during the two-year period that he served as a non-executive director of the BRICS NDB. National Treasury Director-General, Mr Dondo Mogajane, will take over.Social cohesion1.15. Cabinet condemns recent acts of racism by some individuals in our society. Such behaviour goes against the ethos of our constitutional rights, responsibilities and values, and has no place in our democratic society.Cabinet commends the management of private companies that deal swiftly with racism, indicating that racism is a scourge in society, and has to always be fought in the quest to entrench social cohesion and heal the pains of the past.  We all have a responsibility to act swiftly whenever racism and discrimination occurs within our society. We all have a responsibility to build a new nation as envisaged after the first democratic elections.1.16. Cabinet raised its concern about the state of job losses in the country, particularly in the retail and mining sectors. However, it welcomed the efforts made by the mining sector to engage in dialogue that seek to save jobs. The recent approval of Lonmin s application to acquire Anglo Platinum s 42,5% stake in Pandora   a joint venture between Lonmin and Anglo Platinum   is welcomed. This joint venture has in turn saved more than 3 000 jobs and is a relief, especially in the current global economic climate. Government remains committed to creating an environment that is conducive to economic growth and job creation.1.17. Cabinet welcomed the court decision that reaffirmed the prerogative of the government to make policy decisions and directives by dismissing with costs an application by the Metal Recyclers Association of South Africa. The Constitutional Court dismissed an application by local exporters of scrap metal for leave to appeal the judgement of the High Court of South Africa and the Supreme Court of Appeal.The Court has upheld the State s scrap metal export provisions known as price-preference for domestic foundries, mini-mills and secondary smelters scrap metal. It provides for a price discounted by 20% to international prices before qualifying for an export permit. This policy will help to reindustrialise the country s economy and create jobs.1.18. Cabinet welcomed the commitment by the Canadian Government to cooperate with South Africa in border management. This came after the Minister of Home Affairs, Prof Hlengiwe Mkhize, met with her Canadian counterpart Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizen Mr Ahmed Hussen this week. This exchange will further strengthen the existing relationship between the two countries.2. Cabinet decisions2.1. Cabinet approved the Mandate Paper for the 2018 Budget.

Cabinet approved the Coastal and Marine Tourism Implementation Plan, developed under the auspices of the Operation Phakisa Oceans Economy. The plan will uplift tourism in the ocean economy. It will grow a world-class and sustainable coastal and marine tourism destination that leverages South Africa s competitive advantages in nature, culture and heritage. The Minister of Tourism, Ms Tokozile Xasa, will hold a separate media briefing to unpack this plan.2.3. Cabinet approved South Africa s participation in the Second International Indian Ocean Expedition for 2017   2020. The participation will  support South Africa s Chairpersonship of the Indian Ocean Rim Association in 2017/18.South Africa will use its research vessel SA Agulhas II to conduct marine research while training and building scientific capacity for South Africa and East Africa.The gathering of basic long-term environmental data and information will place the developing countries of the Indian Ocean Rim in a better position to conserve the integrity of its ocean and to find ways to unlock their respective potential ocean economies to improve the lives of their citizens.2.4. Cabinet was apprised on the Chemicals and Waste Economy Phakisa Labs initiative, which is scheduled to commence in August 2017. This forms part of the country s intervention to manage the threats to the environment and human health caused by chemicals and waste.  It will provide a further opportunity for the South African chemical industry to identify manufacturing niches that are associated with Green Chemistry (the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the generation of hazardous substances).2.5. Cabinet was briefed on a number requests to redetermine the provincial boundaries from communities in various provinces. Amongst the areas affected are Elias Motsoaledi Local Municipality, Marblehall Local Municipality and Matatiele Local Municipality.These communities have cited a number of reasons for these requests, such as the geographic location and access to services.

The summit emphasized the need to have concrete outcomes that leverage on our national endowments.Cabinet joins President Jacob Zuma in thanking His Majesty King Mswati III, the outgoing Chairperson of the SADC, for his valuable contribution and leadership, as South Africa assumes the role of chair of the SADC from August 2017 to August 2018.1.2. Cabinet salutes all women, and extends heartfelt thanks to those who participated in celebrating and commemorating women as we close Women s Month, under the theme:  The Year of OR Tambo: Women United in Moving South Arica Forward .Although women have made important gains in South Africa, more needs to be done and government programmes will continue to prioritise the involvement of women in developing our communities, the economy and country. Women still continue to face unacceptable levels of abuse and violence, poverty, unemployment.1.3. Cabinet noted the Poverty Trends Report released by Statistics South Africa and will engage with it. Cabinet reiterated its commitment to its pro-poor programmes, particularly as it relates to children coming from poor households.Over the last 23 years, government has increased the social grants programme to poor and vulnerable communities from 2, 7 million to 17 million people. This programme covers over 91% of eligible children and 95,5% of the eligible old age people. Over 20 000 schools have been declared no-fee schools, with over nine million learners benefiting from the school nutrition programmes.The National Student Financial Aid Scheme has since 1999 disbursed more than R72 billion in loans and bursaries to students from poor households. This has resulted in more than two million students from poor communities accessing tertiary education. A total of 1,7 million children are accessing registered Early Childhood Development services, which is a critical foundation for education. In 2012 government also introduced a school health programme, which is an intervention to some of the barriers that hinder progress in some of the learners.Additionally, government has a number of anti-poverty measures which provide free access to basic services to millions of indigent families such as free piped water, sanitation, free electricity and refuse removal. Government has also implemented public employment programmes and housing schemes to enable poor families to have houses.Government will continue to find ways to strengthen some of the social security programmes that are designed to cushion the poor and vulnerable communities.1.4. Cabinet commends the launch of the Ghana Radio Astronomy Observatory, by the Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo and South Africa s Minister of Science and Technology, Ms Naledi Pandor.This is significant for Africa s participation in the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project. The observatory in Ghana is the first other than South Africa, as one of the partner countries.As SKA Africa partners, the SKA South Africa/Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory group collaborated with Ghana to harness the radio astronomy potential of the redundant satellite communication antenna at Kuntunse.The Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) has funded a large part of the conversion project through the African Renaissance and International Cooperation Fund, which is aimed at strengthening cooperation between South Africa and other African countries.A vital part of the effort towards building the SKA on the African continent over the next decade is to develop the skills, regulations and institutional capacity needed in SKA partner countries to optimise African participation in the project.1.5. Cabinet welcomes the announcement from the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Ms Edna Molewa that South Africa is finalizing in the outstanding three provinces, a verification and audits of all the existing privately owned rhino horn stockpiles.The initial audit which was conducted by the provinces is being checked and verified by the national Department of Environmental Affairs.This will assist in preventing the potential smuggling of illegally obtained rhino horns and will ensure that the country has full and accurate information on the number of horns in South Africa at any given time, as well as the registered owner of each one of such horns.On the ruling by the North Gauteng High Court on the issuing of the permit on the selling of Rhino horns to breeder Mr John Hume, which saw South Africa s first online auction of Rhino horn, Cabinet reiterates amongst several other operational conditions, that; the position permit holder, who must have acquired a sellers permit can only sell rhino horn to a person who has a buyers permit issued in terms of the National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act, 2004 (Act 10 of 2004), authorizing him/her to buy rhino horn from a sellers permit holder, in this case being Mr Hume.The permit does not authorize international trade in rhino horn. International trade on horn remains banned, in terms of the provisions on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).During the entire auction the department of environment must be granted access to the online auction to do the necessary compliance monitoring.South Africa remains committed to a regulated process that manages the trade in threatened or protected species in line with the domestic legislation, as well as the legally binding provisions of the CITES.1.6. Cabinet welcomes the High Court guilty verdict against the perpetrators involved in a case involving racially motivated violation of an African man by being put in a coffin.The guilty verdict will serve as a warning to those who still continue to harbor racial prejudices in the country. Cabinet reassures South Africans that any form of racism or act of hate will not be tolerated.  Social cohesion remains an imperative that all of us as a society needs to build and strengthen.1.7. Cabinet welcomed the Constitutional Court Judgement that ruled that municipalities can no longer hold new property owners liable for previous owners  historical municipal debt.  The ruling is a relief to property owners, some of whom have been burdened with debt dating back 20 years. Such a ruling paves way for future new property owners. Cabinet calls on municipalities to align their debt collections system to the ruling.1.8. Cabinet notes that National Treasury is overseeing a forensic investigation into alleged irregularities in the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) programme. Cabinet commends National Treasury for its robust internal audit controls, which identified irregular expenditure. It trusts that the appropriate lessons will be learned with respect to the challenges experienced, and any deliberate wrongdoing or negligence will be identified and the parties held accountable.Cabinet has full confidence in the institutional strength of National Treasury and its custodianship of public finances. Cabinet further expresses its faith in the IFMS programme s implementing agencies   National Treasury, the Department of Public Service and Administration, and the State Information Technology Agency   to implement the project successfully.1.9. Cabinet condemns the leak of a Cabinet Memo proposing options for recapitalizing the South African Airways. A Cabinet Memo is a classified document and leaking it contravenes the government s information security framework, the Minimum Information Security Standards.Cabinet has tasked the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster to investigate the leak of classified information and calls for relevant punitive measures to be applied to those responsible.1.10. Cabinet welcomes the increase in funding by the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) for investment in productive capacity in South Africa, as reflected in its recently released financial results to March 2017. During the National Women s Month, the IDC approved funding of R3,2 billion for women-empowered businesses, an increase of 178% compared to the previous year.This included funding for a transaction that places control of a large manganese mine in the hands of a black South African woman. Funding for black-empowered companies amounted to R10,1 billion, of which R4,7 billion was for investment projects led by black industrialists. These numbers underscore the progress made with transformation of economic ownership in the country. A total of 20 881 jobs were created or saved in the full IDC funding for the year, which amounted to R15,3 billion, the highest level yet.Over the past five years from 2013, the IDC committed R68 billions of funding to investment projects. Together with private sector co-funding, this facilitated investments worth R200 billion and created or saved 99 000 jobs. Cabinet congratulates the IDC and the Economic Development Department on this performance at a time when efforts to boost investment and job creation are critical.1.11. Cabinet welcomes the setting up of a Market Inquiry into high data costs and notes the gazetting of the terms of reference by the Competition Commission. The Market Inquiry arose out of a request by the Minister of Economic Development in terms of the Competition Act. High data costs have serious economic effects, increases the costs of doing business and can limit the ability of South Africa to successfully utilise new information technologies. Cabinet supports the call on service providers in the sector to cut data costs.1.12. Cabinet welcomes the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Flanders on promotion of the Social Economy in South Africa. The New Growth Path economic strategy adopted in 2010 identified the social economy as one of 10 job drivers.In terms of the MoU, the Minister of Economic Development will work in partnership with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Government of Flanders to document successful examples of social enterprises and will engage local stakeholders on the development of a policy framework to consolidate and strengthen work on the social economy.Flanders will also partner with the Department of Environmental Affairs in a project on climate change and the green economy, which will focus on adaptation strategies.1.13. Cabinet is saddened by the loss of life on the country s roads caused by persistent negligent, reckless and irresponsible drivers. Recently 13 children were injured after an alleged drunken driver crashed a taxi into a tree. Two weeks ago another incidence happened in KwaZulu-Natal, which resulted in 19 deaths and nine injured after a taxi crashed into a bridge.Cabinet appeals to all those with children in their care to be extra vigilant about drivers transporting children and commuters. Cabinet calls on the law enforcement agencies to be more vigilant on our roads to ensure the safety of the road users.1.14. Cabinet condemns violence, vandalism, and burning of public infrastructure such as the recent Rea Vaya bus station in Gauteng.  Public transport Infrastructure is a national resource that is meant to serve the public. No amount of dissatisfaction by communities can justify the destruction of property. Cabinet calls on the law enforcement agencies to deal with such criminality.1.15. Cabinet applauded the financial contribution by the National Disaster Management Centre to the Western Cape Provincial Government. More than R74 million was made available to address drought-related challenges, including recent ravaging fires and shortage of livestock feed.  Cabinet continues to call on South Africans to utilize water sparingly.2. Cabinet decisions2.1. Cabinet welcomed an increase in the uptake of locally developed technologies and innovations in South Africa. Science and technology is a key enabler in the multipronged national effort to secure higher economic growth rates in the National Development Plan.According to the 2015 Science, Technology and Innovation Performance Report of the National Advisory Council on Innovation (NACI) a technology expenditure nearly doubled as a percentage of GDP from 0.018% in 2005 to 0.033% in 2015. More departments, private sector and research institutions have invested a great deal of technology and innovation in their respective developmental programmes.As a way of further strengthening these achievements, Cabinet approved three opportunity areas identified by Department of Science and Technology to support in the health technologies, defense and security related technologies and social infrastructure in respect of technology.Cabinet also endorsed additional work of tracking and measuring the development of technology and innovation in social and economic development.3. Bills3.1. Cabinet approved for the introduction of the Overvaal Resorts Limited Bill of 2017 into Parliament.The focus of the Bill is to repeal Aventura s founding legislation, the Overvaal Resorts Limited Act, 1993 (Act 127 of 1993).

The Bill went out for public consultation in March 2017.3.2. In aligning legislation with developments in the education landscape, Cabinet approved for the publication of the Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill of 2017 in the Government Gazette for public comment.The Bill is the outcome of the review of all basic education legislation with a view to enhancing organisational efficiency so as to improve school governance, leadership and accountability, transforming education services, and protecting vulnerable groups to ensure the well-being of learners.Amendments were proposed to the South African Schools Act, 1996 (Act 84 of 1996), and the Employment of Educators Act, 1998 (Act 76 of 1998).4.

The same pattern is also evident in imports, with China remaining the biggest source of imports.The 2017 BRICS Summit will feature five key priorities namely, deepening cooperation, strengthening global governance, undertaking people-to-people exchanges, advancing institutional improvements and building broader partnerships.The strategic focus for South Africa in BRICS is to promote value-added trade, attract investment into the country s productive sectors and enhance cooperation to advance our development objectives.4.4. Cabinet noted the participation of South African companies in the 53rd edition of the Maputo International Trade Fair, commonly known as FACIM, which is taking place in Mozambique from 28 August to 3 September 2017. FACIM is an international multi-sectoral trade fair held annually to showcase Mozambique as an attractive destination for trade and investment. Twenty companies were funded by the Department of Trade and Industry (the dti) while 10 were supported by the Mpumalanga Economic Growth Agency.

Issues in the environment1.1. Economy1.1.1. Cabinet welcomes the positive growth in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 2.5% in the second quarter of 2017, which has moved the country out of a technical recession. Last week, Statistics South Africa released the figures, which represent a year-on-year growth of 1.1%.1.1.2. Although cautiously optimistic, Cabinet is convinced the country is seeing the first positive signs of what is hopefully the start of the country s economic recovery firmly built on the implementation of the Nine-Point Plan, which aims to grow the South African economy and create much-needed jobs.This has resulted in the launch of four industrial parks and the rise in net exports of agricultural raw products on average by 14.6% a year since 2012.1.1.3. The Black Industrialist Programme has supported 62 projects that have attracted R26 billion in private-sector investment and created 19 859 jobs to date.

Total bilateral trade between South Africa and other BRICS countries amounted to US$29 billion last year. South Africa s biggest export destination within BRICS remains China, followed by India, Brazil and Russia. The same pattern is also evident in imports, with China remaining the biggest source of South African imports. Even though South Africa has abundant natural resources, it is critical to implement beneficiation programmes to support our industrialisation policy.1.4.5. The adoption of the BRICS Xiamen Declaration and Action Plan highlighted the strong foundation that BRICS has made in terms of establishing institutional mechanisms for tangible cooperation.1.4.6. Cabinet is honoured that South Africa is the incoming Chair of BRICS and entrenches its aim at the forefront to build on the BRICS programme of development and prosperity for partner countries, as it prepares to host the 10th BRICS Summit in 2018.1.5.

Cabinet is grateful to those in South Africa who have heeded the call to save water.1.8.2. South Africa is a water-stressed country and the persistent drought conditions in parts of the country are a reminder to all people to save every drop by using water wisely and sparingly.1.8.3. Although efforts to save water help ease the pressure on water source the lower than normal seasonal rain reported in the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal is evidence that more needs to be done to conserve water.1.8.4. The Inter-Ministerial Task Team on Drought, led by the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, continues to monitor the drought conditions and offer the required support through relevant sector departments to mitigate the situation.1.8.5.

These developments detract from the country s concerted efforts in creating a climate of free trade and fair competition.1.13. Councillors1.13.1.1. Cabinet condemns the attacks and killings of councillors in some provinces and extends its deepest condolences to the families and friends of those murdered. This goes against the ethos of the Constitution, and detracts from our developmental democracy and the right of people to elect their public representatives.1.13.2. Since the beginning of the year, there have been several deaths in KwaZulu-Natal and recently, deaths have also been reported in the Eastern Cape.1.13.3. This violence has taken the lives young activists, including the fearless former African National Congress Youth League Secretary-General Sindiso Magaqa, who still had much to contribute in building a prosperous South Africa.1.13.4.

Issues in the EnvironmentGDP Growth ResultsCabinet is pleased with South Africa s economy growth which grew by an annualised 2% in the third quarter of 2017, from an upwardly revised 2.8% in the second quarter. The stronger-than-expected performance was mainly due to continued strong growth in the agriculture sector, which contributed 0.9 percentage points to overall growth on the back of 44.2 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth.Strong performance in agriculture, which has seen three consecutive quarters of robust growth, was due to higher production of field crops (such as maize) in summer rainfall areas and horticultural products. Mining and manufacturing also contributed to the growth recorded, with mining and quarrying increasing by 6.6% and contributing 0.5 percentage points to growth.The electricity sector was the biggest laggard, down by 5.5%. Growth in household consumption of 2.6% was mainly due to spending on durable goods, which accounted for 1.6 percentage points of the 2.6% increase. Stronger-than-expected growth and the upward revision to the second quarter growth outcomes means growth could reach 0.9 per cent in 2017.This is higher than the 0.7 per cent anticipated at the time of the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement. Government needs to ensure that this growth momentum is maintained by continuing to implement the 14 confidence-boosting measures that build on improving consumer confidence and can restore business confidence.InvestSA One-Stop ShopCabinet welcomes the launch of the InvestSA One-Stop Shop in KwaZulu-Natal by President Jacob Zuma as part of efforts to improve the ease of doing business in South Africa.

The most recent cases of Nonkululeko Mpanza and Nompumelelo Mhlongo in Thokoza, Ekurhuleni; Katlego Joja in Mamelodi, Tshwane; Promise Mthembu in KwaZulu-Natal; and Jabulile Nhlapo, the Unisa student, brings into sharp focus the level of violence that threatens the lives of our women and children.1.2. Cabinet expresses its deepest condolences to the families and friends of these women and children. The issue of crime against women and children requires all of us to actively be involved in fighting it.1.3.  Cabinet continues to strengthen law-enforcement agencies in the fight to stop GBV. Amongst the Bills approved in this last Cabinet is the Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill of 2018, which amends the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977 (Act 51 of 1977). The Bill will extend the list of sexual offences in respect of the prosecution and significantly it will allow the sexual cases to go before courts even after 20 years.    1.4.

EconomyCabinet welcomes the positive growth in employment of two hundred and six thousand jobs reflected in the first quarter of 2018, from the latest Quarterly Labour Force Survey released by Statistics South Africa. The upswing in employment was driven by increases in six of the 10 industries. The unemployment rate amongst our young people, however, remains high at 52.4%, with an absorption rate of only 12.2%. Cabinet calls on sectors of society to continue to pull together to tackle youth unemployment.In the spirit of  Thuma Mina   Send Me  inspired by President Cyril Ramaphosa in his maiden State of the Nation Address in February 2018, Cabinet calls on all South Africans, in particular the private sector, to help create jobs and invest locally so that more South Africans can be drawn into the economy.3.

Cabinet condemned in the strongest terms the acts of violent aggression carried out by Israeli armed forces along the Gaza border, which led to the deaths of a large number of civilians. Given the indiscriminate and grave manner of the latest Israeli attack, the South African government made a decision to recall Ambassador Sisa Ngombane until further notice.5.2. Cabinet calls on the Israeli Defence Force to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and bring to an end the violent and destructive incursions into Palestinian territories. Their routine actions present yet another obstacle to a permanent resolution to the conflict, which must come in the form of two states, Palestine and Israel, existing side-by-side and in peace.5.3. Cabinet reiterates calls made by several member states of the United Nations for an independent inquiry into the killings, with a view to hold those responsible accountable.6.

Cabinet approved the Amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, to be tabled in Parliament.The Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material is the only legally binding international instrument in the area of physical protection of nuclear material.

Statement on the Cabinet Meeting of 6 June 2018,8 Jun 2018,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-6-june-2018-8-jun-2018-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-6-june-2018-8-jun-2018-0000," Cabinet met on Wednesday, 6 June 2018, at the Union Buildings, Pretoria.A. Issues in the environment1.Economy Cabinet has noted the decline of 2,2% in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the first quarter of 2018. Statistics South Africa (StatsSA) released the figures this week. The agriculture, mining and manufacturing industries contributed to the decline in this first quarter. Cabinet has mandated the Economic Cluster Ministers to urgently meet to discuss the way forward with regard to these figures.  The GDP results bring into sharp focus the need for all sectors of the country to work together to support South Africa s local economy. Business and labour need to continue to work with government in support of initiatives such as the Nine-Point Plan to stimulate economic growth and create much-needed jobs. One of its key pillars is the Industrial Policy Action Plan (IPAP), which focuses on increasing manufacturing, employment creation and exports. Cabinet is confident that the IPAP will help grow our industrial sector and economy.Later this year, government will host an International Investment Summit to profile South Africa as an investment destination. The aim of the event is to work towards generating R1,2 trillion in new investments over the next five years, which will have a significant impact on economic growth and employment creation.2. Investments Cabinet welcomes the launch of a new world-class factory that manufactures information and communications technology products in East London in the Eastern Cape on 5 June 2018 by Yekani Manufacturing, a wholly black-owned company. This R1-billion investment will create 1 000 new quality jobs in addition to the existing workforce of 450, mostly youth and women.This investment has benefited from both the Special Economic Zone Infrastructure Incentive and the Black Industrialist Scheme (BIS).  The BIS saw the Department of Trade and Industry (the dti) approving incentive support to 103 black industrialists over the previous two financial years. Forty-eight companies were also provided with market access support, eight of which are in the Eastern Cape.3. National Minimum Wage (NMW)Cabinet welcomes the passing of the NMW Bill by the National Assembly. It expresses its appreciation to all stakeholders at the National Economic Development and Labour Council for their role in reaching this agreement. This begins a process towards narrowing the wage gap, especially for the low income earners. Approximately 6,4 million workers in South Africa will benefit once the Bill has been signed into law. Cabinet, however, acknowledges that more work still needs to be done to close the wage disparities that still exist in the country. The Bill will now be sent to the National Council of Provinces for concurrence before the President signs it into law.4. Basic servicesCabinet is pleased with the results of the Non-financial Census of Municipalities 2017 released by StatsSA. The results showed more consumers have received free basic services such as electricity, water and sanitation in 2017 as compared with 2016. Government remains committed to providing daily basic services to all its citizens, especially poor people. The most recent water-related project is the R96-million Mhlathuze Water Project in Richards Bay in KwaZulu-Natal, which will deliver running tap water to more than 6 000 households.5. Public Service wage negotiationsCabinet received a briefing from the Minister of Public Service and Administration on the Public Service wage negotiations. Cabinet appreciates the commitment by all stakeholders in finding an amicable solution that would benefit all role players. Cabinet reaffirms government s commitment to fully engage with labour so as to arrive at a workable deal for all involved.6. Social grants Cabinet reassures beneficiaries of social grants that government will continue providing this important service, as mandated by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996. Social grants will continue to be paid and the process to replace the old South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) card with the new one will continue until the end of September 2018. The partnership between SASSA and the South African Post Office is yielding positive results as more beneficiaries have since May 2018 been coming forward to swap their cards.Cabinet urges communities to ignore recent short messages directing social-grant beneficiaries to re-register for their social grants to avoid not being paid. Such misleading messages seek to create confusion amongst the poor and derail government from ensuring that social grants are seamlessly paid to beneficiaries without failure. 7. North WestCabinet received a third progress report from the Inter-Ministerial Task Team (IMTT) on North West. Cabinet is satisfied with the progress made to operationalise the invoked Section 100(1) (a) and (b) in the North West provincial departments. It was further approved that the IMTT will onwards report to Cabinet once a month to enable the teams deployed in the province to continue with the work.Cabinet endorsed a visit to the North West on 7 June 2018 to brief the North West Executive, Provincial Legislature and the external auditors responsible for the province.8. Protest action Cabinet condemns the recent violent protests around the country, and is especially saddened by the acts of violence and intimidation of patients and medical staff at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital. Protestors who exercise their rights to protest should do so without violating the rights of others, particularly the vulnerable. No amount of grievance justifies violence and the threatening behaviour seen in the past week.9. Safety and securityCabinet welcomes and supports the  stabilisation intervention plan  by the South African Police Service (SAPS), which will partner with South Africans towards efforts to make our communities safer. The high-density visibility of uniformed police officers on foot and vehicles   supported by the SAPS air wing, continuous cordon and search operations, roadblocks and relentless search for wanted suspects   will go a long way in ensuring that people in our country are and feel safe. Communities are encouraged to provide information relating to their safety to a local police station or call the toll-free Crime Stop number: 086 00 10111. Cabinet appeals to members of the public to use the Crime Stop line responsibly. An abuse of this facility may affect a legitimate emergency call that may have saved a life. 10. Youth Month Cabinet urges all South Africans to play their part in youth-empowerment programmes and projects during Youth Month in June. This year is the centenary of Tata Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela and Mama Albertina Nontsikelelo Sisulu and Youth Month 2018 is embraced under the theme:  Live the legacy: Towards a socio-economically empowered youth .Inspired by their iconic legacies, young people need to be empowered to take up a more active role in developing their communities with a view to working together to develop South Africa. Government is working hard to ensure that youth are able to access the many support and educational government programmes that would enhance their participation in the economy. 11. Preliminary and mid-term examsCabinet calls on parents and guardians to support, within necessary means, children who are writing preliminary and mid-term examinations taking place across the country. Cabinet warmly appreciates the vital role child caregivers play in shaping our future leaders whilst creating conducive and safe environments for our children to learn. We also encourage all learners to continue studying and striving to do their best.Cabinet also welcomes the reopening of schools in various parts of North West, including Koster and Rustenburg. This comes after weeks of protests and disruptions in teaching and learning in the areas. Cabinet urges parents, learners and teachers to collaborate in trying to recover the lost time and fully commit to catch-up programmes.12. Drought and fireCabinet reminds South Africans that the country is still experiencing drought. South Africa is one of the 30-driest countries in the world and the lower-than-normal rainfalls have worsened the situation. All people must continue partnering with government to conserve water so as to ensure there is sufficient supply for all. As we enter the winter season, Cabinet calls on communities to take extra care to prevent shack and veld fires. Government continues to work with communities to promote safety measures at this time when many use various forms of fuel and heating to keep warm.  13. Science and TechnologyCabinet notes astrological developments over the past weekend when astronomers working with the Catalina Sky Survey in Arizona, USA, discovered a small asteroid (2018 LA) near the orbit of the Moon, which hours later made contact with Earth. The resultant explosion which sent waves of low-frequency sound (infrasound) rippling through the atmosphere were detected by an infrasound monitor in South Africa, which was deployed as part of the International Monitoring System of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. This highlights the growing capability of modern sky surveys to discover asteroids targeting Earth and South Africa s internationally recognised capability.  B. Cabinet decisions14.

Cabinet approved the reviewed Policy Framework for Accreditation of Diversion Services in South Africa. The policy framework was put in place in 2010 in line with the Child Justice Act, 2008 (Act 75 of 2008).

Six of the chapters have been amended to improve the quality and standards of services provided to children found in conflict with the law.17.

The Minister of Health will next week hold a full media briefing to unpack this Bill.19. Cabinet approved for the introduction of the Science and Technology Laws Amendment Bill of 2017 to Parliament. The Bill harmonizes the provisions which regulate the operations and governance of the public entities that report to the Minister of Science and Technology. This will ensure consistency in all requirements to be met and processes to be followed. D. Upcoming events20. Group of Seven (G7) SummitCabinet welcomes South Africa s invitation to attend the upcoming G7 Summit in Canada. South Africa participated in the summit seven years ago and this invitation is an indication of renewed confidence in the South African economy.

South Africa-India 125 Years Anniversary Event As part of the Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu centenary celebrations, Cabinet welcomes the commemoration on 7 June 2018 of Mahatma Gandhi s removal from a train at Pietermaritzburg Station 125 years ago.

Issues in the environment1. Mandela MonthCabinet calls on all South Africans to  Be the Legacy  as we approach Nelson Mandela International Day on 18 July 2018.  The United Nations (UN) adopted this day, which allows South Africans and the global community to honour our former President and an international icon, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela.Government has declared July as Mandela Month, which falls on his birthday month.  As part of the centenary celebration various sectors have embarked on a number of initiatives to pay tribute to the work and legacy of the late President Nelson Mandela. On Friday, a special tribute to his concerns about jobs and young workers will be paid, when the Wear South Africa initiative, with the Nelson Mandela Foundation and the SA Clothing and Textile Workers Union (SACTWU) launches the Nelson Mandela t-shirt in Durban.The T-shirt is locally made, is available at leading retail stores and profits from the sale of the T-shirt will go to the Nelson Mandela Foundation to fund activities consistent with his vision and life. The Minister of Economic Development will address guests on behalf of Government. Cabinet urges all South Africans to support the buy local campaign and to wear locally-made clothing with pride.Cabinet calls on all people to become part of the movement for change. By working together as a united, non-racial and non-sexist society, we can uphold the legacy of Madiba. Cabinet calls on all South Africans  to dedicate their 67 minutes of their time on 18 July to contribute to making a change for the needy. 2. InvestmentCabinet welcomes the recent primary listing of Old Mutual on the JSE. This listing by a company with a market capitalization of $10bn (R130bn), is a significant vote of confidence in South Africa and the local financial markets.Cabinet appreciates that the primary listing in South Africa returns Old Mutual to its African roots and ends its period as a London-based financial services group. The commitment by Old Mutual to create a Fund of R500 million to promote local economic development, particularly by small, black-owned businesses, will boost the country s efforts to build an inclusive economy. We call on other corporates in the financial sector to develop similar developmental funding instruments through dialogue with Government.The recent World Economic Forum Roundtable on Investment served to showcase the potential of South Africa as a destination for increased and new investment. The Roundtable was attended by a large delegation of Chief Executive Officers of domestic and international firms, who interacted with President Ramaphosa and a delegation of Cabinet Ministers. The discussions were helpful in identifying measures to increase levels of investment and is a significant step towards the Investment Conference that will be convened by the President later this year.3. Land expropriationCabinet appreciates the start of the Parliament s public participation process to review Section 25 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996 which will allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. Parliament set up the Constitutional Review Committee to conduct public hearings countrywide after passing a motion on the expropriation of land without compensation. These public hearings will take place in all the nine provinces until August 2018.Cabinet calls on all interested parties to participate peacefully in these hearings and appeals to the public to remain tolerant of varying views that may be expressed, in order to ensure that all have a fair opportunity to participate in the hearings.Cabinet also reflected on the concerns expressed by traditional leaders on land issues. As a result, it has appointed a team of Ministers to interact with the traditional leaders to discuss and seek an amicable solution to their areas of concern. The Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Dr Zweli Mkhize, is the convener and is supported by Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Senzeni Zokwana, Rural Development and Land Reform Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane and Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane.4. Tax seasonCabinet encourages all taxpayers to submit their annual tax returns for the 2017/18 tax season, which opened for filing on 1 July 2018. Proper and efficient revenue collection ensures fiscal sovereignty, and timeous and accurate submissions ensure that taxpayers remain compliant. Tax revenue helps government to fund the country s service-delivery projects and other socio-economic development programmes.5. Petrol price increaseCabinet has noted the recent fuel increases, which follows from another price increase in the past month. Another fuel price increase is anticipated next month. The Brent Crude Oil Dollar denominated price has been affecting the general prices of petrol, diesel and paraffin. Our currency s exchange rate to the US dollar has fallen by more than one percent since the beginning of May this year.These cyclical currency changes, which result in price fluctuations, have impacted negatively on the consumers, particularly the poor. The rise in petrol prices directly affects transport costs, food prices particularly the cost of staple food and medicine. Cabinet assures South Africans that government is making an effort to alleviate the challenges faced by poor communities. National Treasury has appointed a nine-member panel of experts to review the current list of Value-Added Tax (VAT) zero-rated items currently consisting of 19 basic food items. President Cyril Ramaphosa is leading the team, comprising representative from both government and private sector, to draw in more investors into the country so as to grow our economy and create much-needed jobs, particularly for unemployed youth.Cabinet appeals to the private sector to lend a hand, by delaying to transfer the impact of the fuel prices to the consumer. This will go a long way in cushioning the poor, who will be directly affected by these price fluctuations. Growing our economy will go a long way in stabilising our economy. Cabinet also appeals to the private sector to partner with government for the benefit of all affected South Africans, particularly the poor.6. Payment of social grantsCabinet was briefed by the Minister of Social Development, Susan Shabangu, on the recent widespread delays in scheduled social grant payments to beneficiaries. Cabinet appreciates that social grants are a lifeline to the most vulnerable members of our society and therefore such inconvenience is very much regrettable. It expressed its sincere apology to all affected beneficiaries.Minister Shabangu has assured Cabinet that the technical glitches were a result of the transition of the payments from an old system to a new South African Social Security Agency/South African Post Office system. She has assured Cabinet that most, of the affected beneficiaries have since been paid. Meanwhile, dedicated teams are working hard to stabilise the systems to prevent a recurrence of such delays in the future.7. Health InquiryCabinet welcomes the release today of the interim report by the Competition Market Inquiry into the private healthcare industry. The Inquiry is chaired by the ex-Chief Justice, Sandile Ngcobo and has heard evidence from a number of stakeholders in the past three years.

The final report will be submitted to the Minister of Economic Development, by the end of 2018, and will be tabled in parliament.8. Khartoum DeclarationCabinet welcomes the agreement on a permanent ceasefire between South Sudan President Salva Kiir and Riek Machar, and the signing of the Khartoum Declaration. This raises hope of a deal to end their country s devastating war.The declaration stipulates that the ceasefire arrangement includes disengagement, separation of forces in close proximity, withdrawal of all allied troops, opening of humanitarian corridors and the release of prisoners of war and political detainees. The agreement also allows members of the African Union (AU) and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development to deploy forces to supervise the ceasefire.Cabinet encourages all parties to work together to ensure that the ceasefire finally leads to ending the war and ensure the return of peace and economic development in South Sudan.9. African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFRA)Cabinet welcomes South Africa s signing of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement with the AU. The signing of this agreement by South Africa brings the number of countries who have signed to forty nine.The AfCFTA takes the continent closer to the creation of the world s biggest free trade area. It is expected to yield great socio-economic benefits for all countries in the continent.According to the UN, it is estimated that the AfCFTA will boost intra Africa trade by 53% by eliminating import duties and non-tariff barriers. This agreement is potentially poised to create an African market of more than 1.2 billion people with an economy worth US$2.5 trillion.The Minister of Trade and Industry will commence the process to get the Agreement ratified through Parliament.10. African AgendaCabinet welcomes the 6th Southern African Customs Union (SACU) Summit held on 29 June 2018 in Botswana, which was attended by President Ramaphosa.

The amendments provide for an extension of the mandate of the competition authorities and the Executive to address high levels of economic concentration, limited transformation in the South African economy and abuse of market power by dominant firms.The Bill has already been gazetted for public comment and discussed with all the relevant stakeholders.D.

Statement on the Cabinet Meeting of 22 August 2018,23 Aug 2018,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-22-august-2018-23-aug-2018-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-22-august-2018-23-aug-2018-0000,"Cabinet met on Wednesday, 22 August 2018 at Tuynhuys in Cape Town.A. Issues In The Environment1. Economy1.1. The recent economic developments in Turkey have led to a large depreciation of emerging market currencies, including the South African Rand.1.2. Capital outflows from these markets have accelerated and bond yields have risen, slowing down economic growth and job creation. Turkey s large foreign currency denominated liabilities and relatively low levels of foreign currency reserves predisposed the country to large and damaging capital outflows, as monetary policy started to normalise in advanced economies.1.3. Cabinet notes that South Africa has a number of strengths, including an independent central bank, an inflation-targeting regime with inflation consistently within the target range, low levels of foreign-currency debt and a clear fiscal consolidation plan. Cabinet is committed to maintaining these strengths.1.4. At the same time, government will continue to implement reforms to increase the growth potential of the economy and improve the credibility of our policy decisions.1.5. Government will continue to collaborate with business, labour and civil society to restore confidence in the economy and address the structural constraints to economic growth. Working together we can translate our plans into concrete actions to move the South African economy forward.2. Value-Added Tax (VAT)2.1. Cabinet welcomes the report by the Ministerial Panel of Experts which reviewed the list of zero-rated VAT items and recommended the inclusion of white bread, bread flour, cake flour, sanitary products and school uniforms.Cabinet encourages South Africans to voice their opinions on the report, which is open for public comment until 31 August 2018. The Minister of Finance, Mr Nhlanhla Nene, will then make an informed choice on which proposals to implement. Submissions can be made in writing to vatsubmissions@treasury.gov.za3. Women s Month3.1. Cabinet calls on all citizens to continue with the drive to ensure the safety and empowerment of women in our society.  We commend all sectors of society for heading up initiatives aimed at fighting gender-based violence (GBV).3.2. As Women's Month draws to a close, Cabinet continues to honour women in the same spirit that we honour the women of 1956 who marched to the Union Buildings in Pretoria in defiance of a brutal regime that sought to use discriminatory pass laws to undermine their dignity.3.3. Since the start of our democracy in 1994, great strides have been made to ensure that women enjoy the same rights as their male counterparts in education, employment, property, inheritance and justice. In driving an inclusive economy, we are working hard to ensure the full participation of women in the economy and driving an inclusive economy.3.4. As part of celebrating Women s Month, the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries   in partnership with the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform, and Total South Africa   will on Thursday, 23 August 2018 hold its 19th Annual Female Entrepreneur Awards in East London in the Eastern Cape.3.5. Government, together with its partners, will hold a National Gender Summit to forge consensus on how best to deal with GBV.3.6. The Minister of Police, Mr Bheki Cele, has recommitted members of the South African Police Service (SAPS) to prioritise cases that involve the abuse of women and children. When a woman or a child reports a crime or abuse, it must be followed up with the urgency it deserves and taken to its full conclusion. 4. Land expropriation  Cabinet thanks South Africans who participated in the parliamentary public hearings into the possible review of Section 25 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996 to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. Parliament s Constitutional Review Committee has concluded hearings in all Provinces. The deliberations on these hearings as well as written inputs will now be considered by Parliament.Discussions on the issue of land ownership in South Africa is vital and working together we can ensure that land reforms can further assist in growing our economy particularly in the agricultural sector and address the land ownership inequalities in our country.President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed an Inter-Ministerial Committee chaired by Deputy President David Mabuza to coordinate and implement measures to accelerate the redistribution of land, the extension of security of tenure, the provision of agricultural support and the redress of spatial inequality, within a broad and comprehensive land redistribution and agricultural development programme.5. Sanitation Appropriate for Education (SAFE) Initiative5.1. Cabinet welcomes the launch by President Ramaphosa of the SAFE Initiative, as part of government s response to the sanitation challenges facing some of the country s poorest schools.5.2. The SAFE Initiative is led by the Department of Basic Education, in partnership with the National Education Collaboration Trust and the Nelson Mandela Foundation.5.3. Cabinet calls on all sectors of society, including big business and non-governmental organisations, to support the initiative that is aimed at alleviating infrastructure backlogs for schools in poor communities.6. National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS)Cabinet was briefed by the Minister of Higher Education and Training, Ms Naledi Pandor, on the challenges facing the NSFAS.  In order to stabilise and decisively address the challenges faced by the NSFAS in the disbursement of funds to deserving students, Cabinet supported the appointment of the Administrator, Dr Randall Carolissen.The appointment of the Dr Carolissen effectively dissolves the current NSFAS Board. The Administrator together with the management will work towards dealing decisively with backlogs and other challenges facing the entity so as to ensure student funding is administered optimally for 2019, and that all outstanding issues for 2017 and 2018 are resolved.7. RetrenchmentsCabinet is concerned by recent announcements over possible retrenchments and job losses in some industries, including mining and media.  We reiterate our appeal to business to consider retrenchment only as a last resort, and to explore other available and innovative ways to sustain jobs.  Government continues to partner with business and labour, and remains convinced that working together, we can grow our economy and create new jobs.8. BroadcastingCabinet welcomes the news that the SABC will screen English Premiership League games. While this may be a revenue opportunity for the SABC, government hopes that the screening of these games will not sacrifice local sports and also worsen the financial position of the public broadcaster, given its current liquidity challenges.Cabinet notes the Invitation to Apply for the licensing of spectrum for the provision of subscription broadcasting services by the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa.While matters pertaining to licensing are the exclusive domain of the regulator, consistent with Section 192 of the Constitution, the licensing process should be done in a manner that does not destabilize the free-to-air platform during the transition from analogue to digital or encourages uncompetitive behaviour. It should ensure that new licensees are able to compete fairly and openly.B.    Cabinet Decisions1.    Cabinet approved the submission of the Agreement establishing the African Continental Free Trade Area to Parliament for ratification.  This agreement will result in access to new and dynamic markets in the rest of Africa, in particular new markets in West Africa and North Africa. It will also provide export opportunities for South African products. This will also be in line with the integrated development approach in the continent. It will stimulate industrial development, investment and the creation of jobs in the continent.2. Study on spectrum licensingCabinet approved the outcome of the commissioned study by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which sought to determine the amount of spectrum for open access and licensing to the industry.  The study confirms that spectrum can be licensed to both the Wireless Open Access Network (WOAN) and the industry.  This will, amongst others, achieve the national policy obligations, cost of communication; remove the entry barriers for small and medium companies, and sustain the current investments. The Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services, Dr Siyabonga Cwele, will hold a full media briefing to unpack this report.3. Progress on North WestCabinet received the fourth progress report on the Section 100(1) intervention in North West. Cabinet is satisfied with the implementation stage, with several milestones reached in terms of the institutionalization of the project in the province.  The Memorandum of Understanding between the national and provincial government has been signed from the Inter-Ministerial Task Team (IMTT) on North West;  Five administrators for the departments placed under Section 100(1)b have been appointed and formally installed as accounting officers;The protocols and directives between the respective National Ministers and provincial MECs have been signed in line with Section 100(1)(b); andAn overall coordinator for the management of the North West intervention has been appointed.Cabinet further expressed appreciation to the immediate intervention by the South African National Defense Force (SANDF) and the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agent to the sewage crisis in the Ditsobotla Local Municipality in North West.  The spillage of the sewerage, which had become a health hazard to the community, has been cleared.  Cabinet commended the work that has been done to date by the Administrators under the leadership of the IMTT, chaired by Minister Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma.4. Integrated Resource Plan (IRP)Cabinet approved the publication of the updated Integrated Resource Plan for public input. The National Development Plan identifies the need for South Africa to invest in a strong network of economic infrastructure designed to support the country s medium- and long-term economic and social objectives. Energy infrastructure is a critical component that underpins economic activity and growth across the country; it needs to be robust and extensive enough to meet industrial, commercial and household needs.     The finalisation of the IRP will provide the necessary certainty to industry players as well as consumers in so far as security of electricity supply in the medium to long term is concerned. The Minister of Energy, Mr Jeff Radebe, and the department will engage the National Economic Development and Labour Council EXCO on Friday, 24 August on the draft report, which will also be published in the Government Gazette and the Department of Energy s website (www.energy.gov.za) by not later than Monday, 27 August 2018.5. Cabinet approved the Government Communication Policy, which will be applicable across government. The policy sets norms and standards for government communication practitioners. It also compels all government departments to provide a communication budget and a fully funded personnel capacity. The policy will complement the current Code of Conduct for the Public Service.6. Cabinet approved the Final Strategy to Addressing Air Pollution in Dense Low-Income Communities of South Africa for implementation. The strategy provides a coordinated approach in reducing air pollution associated with fossil fuel in dense low-income communities.The current air circulation in these communities exceed the National Ambient Air Quality Standards set out in the National Environmental Management: Air Quality Act, 2004 (Act 39 of 2004). The strategy provides for interventions to reduce pollution and recommends an   awareness programmes that will highlight the health impact of continued pollution. It also provides for alternative energy options.7. Cabinet approved the Green Transport Strategy, which will contribute  towards reducing the emission of greenhouse gas (GHG) in the environment.  Currently, the transport sector accounts for 10, 8% of the total GHG emissions, with road transport being responsible for 91.2% of these GHG emissions.  The strategy introduces a number of interventions that will provide less emissions. It recommends alternative modes of transportations that emit less GHG in the environment. The strategy has already gone through public consultations in 2017.8. Cabinet approved submission of the charter establishing the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Aviation Safety Organisation (SASO) to Parliament for approval. The charter provides a legal and institutional framework to establish SASO, to assist SADC Member States with their civil aviation safety oversight. It will also facilitate the development of efficient and effective civil-aviation infrastructure in SADC Member States.9. Cabinet approved the White Paper on Arts, Culture and Heritage of 2018. The White Paper revokes elements of the White Paper on Arts, Culture and Heritage of 1996.  The White Paper is a culmination of the review of the 1996 White Paper, which appreciated the achievements in all the facets of arts, culture and heritage and reflected on areas that remained a challenge in advancing nation-building and social cohesion in our democracy.  The White Paper aims for a dynamic, vibrant and a transformed South African arts, culture and heritage sector that will contribute towards nation-building, social cohesion and socio-economic inclusion.10. Cabinet approved the National Policy Framework on Underwater Cultural Heritage, which synergizes the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation Convention, the National Heritage Resources Act, 1999 (Act 25 of 1999) and other relevant national legislation.The policy is underpinned by the principle that cultural heritage belongs to all people of South Africa. It identifies a range of stakeholders and actions to promote underwater cultural heritage, and to create awareness of its significance and capacity building.11. Cabinet approved the 2018 and 2019 Annual Stamp Programme from the South African Post Office. The stamps reflect South Africa s diverse culture, national identity, history, rich heritage, heroes and heroines, the environment as well as socio-economic development. The stamps further serve as small ambassadors for South Africa as they travel across the world through the postal network.12. Cabinet approved the designs of the commemorative collectors  coin series to be issued in 2019 by the Mint Company.C.    Bills1.    Cabinet approved the submission of the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill of 2018 to Parliament. The Bill amends three pieces of legislation, namely the Electoral Commission Act, 1996 (Act 51 of 1996); Electoral Act, 1998 (Act 73 of 1998) and the Local Government: Municipal Electoral Act, 2000 (Act 27 of 2000).The Bill makes a number of amendments to adjust the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) election processes.

Statement on the Cabinet Meeting of 5 September 2018,6 Sep 2018,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-5-september-2018-6-sep-2018-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-5-september-2018-6-sep-2018-0000,"Cabinet met on Wednesday, 5 September 2018 at Tuynhuys, Cape Town. A.    Issues in the environment1.    Economy1.1.    Cabinet calls on all sectors of South Africa to rally behind government-led initiatives to boost economic growth following the release of growth figures showing our economy contracted by zero point 7 per cent in the second quarter from a revised -2.6 percent in the first quarter.1.2. Although some sectors of the economy, such as mining, construction and finance, recorded an improvement in growth, this was insufficient to offset fully the contraction in other sectors, in particular the agricultural sector.  1.3.  From the expenditure side, net exports recorded a strong recovery, however this was offset by a contraction in household expenditure and very large draw down in inventories. Investment growth by private companies increased, while investment by the public sector contracted.1.4. The rising volatility in global markets and the GDP outcome require that government accelerates efforts to unblock constraints to economic growth while providing support to vulnerable groups.  1.5.  Economic growth has slowed down significantly over the last four years. This reflects factors such as drought conditions in the agricultural sector and low commodity prices but also domestic structural constraints, which have discouraged investment and employment creation.1.6. Government has committed, to amongst others, a complete overhaul of the visa system to support the tourism sector, the finalisation of key mining legislation to support the mining sector and further stabilise the finances of State-owned enterprises.1.7. The upcoming job and investment summits, as well as the proposed government stimulus package, will provide details on reforms needed to drive growth.1.8.  Cabinet affirms government s commitment to fiscal sustainability and a revised fiscal framework will be presented in the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement.2.  United Kingdom (UK) and Northern Ireland visit2.1. Cabinet joins President Cyril Ramaphosa in welcoming the successful working visit by Prime Minister Theresa May of the UK of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It will yield improved benefits for South Africa through strengthened bilateral trade and investment. The UK is one of the largest foreign investors in South Africa, with over 650 British firms present in our market. During the bilateral engagements, potential partnerships and efforts were discussed.2.2. Prime Minister May also handed over the SS Mendi Bell to South Africa s Commander-in-Chief, President Ramaphosa, and the people of South Africa, to commemorate the sacrifice of over 600 South Africans who perished when the SS Mendi sank in the English Channel over 100 years ago.3. Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) Summit3.1. Cabinet considered the Beijing Action Plan (2019-2021), which details the outcomes of the FOCAC Summit co-chaired by President Ramaphosa and Chinese President Xi Jinping.3.2. To build the China-Africa comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership, China committed to implementing 10 cooperation plans with Africa. These are in the areas of industrialisation; agricultural modernisation; infrastructure; financial services; green development; trade and investment facilitation; poverty reduction and public welfare; public health; people-to-people exchanges, and peace and security. Over the period, cooperation between the two sides will be underpinned by the theme:  China and Africa: Towards an even stronger community with a shared future through win-win cooperation. 4. Fuel price4.1. Cabinet welcomes the unchanged fuel price for this month as a once-off temporary relief for users of public transport, motorists and consumers, while other measures are being sought by the Department of Energy (DoE).   4.2. Global factors including the increase of the price of crude oil and the negative sentiment around emerging markets have led to the cost of fuel rising rapidly in South Africa since April this year.   4.3. Cabinet has expressed concern about increases and the detrimental effects on the general consumer, including amongst others, effects relating to the inflationary impact as producers pass on the increases to the retail sector.4.4. Taking this into account, the Minister of Energy, Mr Jeff Radebe, made a special intervention on behalf of government to cushion the public against yet another steep increase in the fuel price, with the exception of the 4.9 cents per litre increase in the retail margin of petrol to cater for the annual salary increases of employees, such as petrol attendants, at fuel stations.4.5. At a time when the economy is being impacted by global headwinds, Cabinet is pleased that this intervention has no impact on the fiscus as it uses funds that are already in the fuel-pricing structure.5. Land reform  5.1. Cabinet calls on all South Africans to use the debate around the issue of land reform to strengthen nation-building and social cohesion. The unfolding parliamentary process will bring clarity and allow us to move forward as a nation. The transparent, rules-based and constitutional process is in keeping with our commitment to jointly arrive at solutions for the betterment of society.5.2. Cabinet is convinced this process will allow us to determine a land reform model that works for everyone.  5.3. By working together, we can build a better nation where the dreams and aspirations of all our people are realised.  6. Water6.1. Cabinet is pleased that the Department of Water and Sanitation has completed the construction of the Cornelis River Dam in the Free State. The dam, which is set to benefit 2 690 households and an estimated 10 674 people, will ease water challenges faced by the community of Warden and Ezenzeleni under the Phumelela Local Municipality.6.2. South Africa is still experiencing water shortages as a result of drought conditions and Cabinet appeals to all people to use this resource sparingly and to remain water wise.7. Education7.1. Cabinet congratulated the Department of Basic Education for successfully handing over the Delft South Primary School, outside Cape Town in the Western Cape.7.2. The school was built through the department s Accelerated Schools Infrastructure Delivery Initiative (ASIDI) at a cost of R75 million. It consists of 45 classrooms, a computer and science laboratory, library as well as a nutrition centre. The new state-of-the-art facilities will provide a conducive learning and teaching environment to about 1 578 learners from the Delft community.7.3. This is the final school out of 25 schools handed over to the Western Cape through the National Department of Education s initiative. To date, the ASIDI programme has built 205 state-of-the-art-schools nationally.

Over 45 000 potential and current students logged onto the NSFAS website on the first day. Progress has also been made to clear the backlog of outstanding payments to students.8.2. The application process is based on a new system which makes funding decisions quicker while applications are now easily filled in by students regardless of their location.9. Listeriosis9.1. Cabinet welcomes the declaration that the Listeriosis outbreak is over and it strongly demonstrates the impact of the emergency collaborative response plan by the Department of Health (DoH) and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, supported by the World Health Organisation, to control and end the outbreak.9.2. The DoH has put in place a surveillance system to prevent a recurrence. All factories that make ready-to-eat processed meat and chicken need to have food safety management systems in place, according to Regulation R607 published on 14 June 2018. Inspections of factories remain ongoing, according to the updated hygiene regulations.10. Allegations of fake and expired foods10.1. Cabinet commends the swift action taken by the Minister of Health, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, to look into the allegations of fake and expired foods in South Africa. The DoH has received a high volume of complaints and noted concerns about unauthenticated food-related videos that are circulating on social media.10.2. Since August, inspection blitzes have taken place at various food premises and they continue in different parts of the country.10.3. In addition, the food industry has been requested to confirm the authenticity of potential counterfeit foodstuffs while other government regulatory authorities from the departments of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and Trade and Industry, including the National Consumer Commission, are involved in confirming public claims of compromised quality standards.  10.4. Cabinet appeals to the public to be vigilant in differentiating terms related to food:The best-before date refers to the long shelf life of dry and canned products, and is not an indicator of safety.The sell-by date is used for perishable food usually stored in a refrigerator and from July this year became no longer relevant, according to global authorities. The use-by or expiry date is the expiry date and means that food bearing this mark is no longer palatable after this date. For perishable food, this means it can no longer be consumed. Counterfeit goods  are typically goods sold under another company s brand name while the term  fake food  has been used by social media to refer to food that does not contain food substances.10.5. Cabinet reiterates calls on members of society to produce tangible evidence of foodstuff made from potentially harmful substances and chemicals.10.6. Furthermore, Cabinet condemns attacks on and looting of shops as a response to the sale of suspicious foods. Such criminal acts will not be tolerated and Law-enforcement agencies will not hesitate to arrest and prosecute persons found inciting or carrying out these criminal acts. Cabinet urges members of the public who are aware of suspicious foods to call the DoH hotline on 011 386 2003/6 and the National Consumer Commission hotline on 012 428 7000.11. Payment of social grants11.1. Cabinet welcomes the progress report by Social Development Minister, Susan Shabangu, on the partnership between South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) and the South African Post Office (SAPO) to take over the payments of social grants from Cash Paymaster Services with effect from 1 October 2018.  11.2. SASSA has so far replaced about five and a half million old cards with the new SASSA gold card but thousands still need to be exchanged. Cabinet strongly appeals to holders of old cards to make the switch.11.3. SAPO will also take over the payment of cash to those recipients who were unable to withdraw cash from ATMs or merchants. For further information, social-grant beneficiaries can call the SASSA toll-free number on 0800 60 10 11 during office hours.12. Train accident12.1. Cabinet wishes the commuters who were injured when two Metrorail trains collided at the Eloff Extension in Selby, south of Johannesburg, a speedy recovery and calls for the investigation into the cause of the accident to be fast-tracked to prevent a recurrence.B. Cabinet decisions1. Cabinet approved for the release of the 2017/18 National Crime Statistics by the South African Police Service.1.1. The annual crime statistics enable government to monitor key targets, in particular the reduction of reported serious crimes, as set out in the Medium Term Strategic Framework 2014-2019. The crime statistics could also be used as early-warning indicators to strengthen crime-prevention operations and strategies of various government departments.    2. Cabinet was briefed on progress made in the management of discipline of public-service employees conducting business with an organ of state. Promoting just and fair administration actions by senior government officials is a critical part of building an open and accountable government, as envisaged in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996 and the building of a capable state as envisioned in the National Development Plan (NDP): Vision 2030.2.1. Progress has been made in terms of implementing Regulation 13(c) of the Public Service Regulations (PSR) of 2016, which prohibits public-service employees from conducting business with an organ of state, as well as Regulation 18 of the PSR of 2016, which requires members of the Senior Management Service (SMS) to disclose their financial and other private interests.2.2. Cabinet also approved that relevant Executive Authority of government departments should monitor implementation of Regulation 13(c) of the PSR of 2016, take appropriate disciplinary steps and submit a report thereof to the Minister of Public Service and Administration (MPSA) by the end of each financial year. The first report is due for submission to the MPSA by the 31 March 2019.2.3. In 2016 and 2017, the Department of Public Service and Administration identified public-service employees registered as suppliers on the Central Supplier Database, as supplied by National Treasury. Departments were requested to create awareness, to verify information and to report progress with implementation on the steps taken against transgressors.2.4. By the end of April 2018, 96% of all SMS members submitted their disclosures using the eDisclosure System.3. Cabinet was briefed on progress made on the National School of Government (NSG) Funding Model.3.1. Cabinet approved a suit of mandatory and compulsory training programmes to be piloted by the NSG to undertake rapid capacity development interventions and to professionalize the public service. The direct payment for compulsory programmes to the NSG by relevant employing departments from their training budgets was also approved.3.2. This will lead to a developmental public administration that goes further in attaining Vision 2030 of the NDP by  building a capable and developmental state, which working together with an active citizenry, leads a relentless drive against poverty, unemployment and social inequality. 4. Cabinet approved the publication of the White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation of 2018, for public comment. The Minister of Science and Technology, Ms Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane, will provide a full briefing in due course.5. Cabinet also approved the publication of the National Protected Areas Expansion Strategy (NPAES) for public comment.5.1. The NPAES is a 20-year strategic plan aligned to the NDP, focusing on expanding the protected areas estate, with specific focus on economic growth, transformation and sustainability.5.2. The NPAES highlights how scarce human and financial resources can be efficiently and effectively allocated to achieve cost-effective protected area expansion, ecological sustainability and resilience to climate change.5.3. South Africa s protected area network includes world heritage sites, national parks, nature reserves, special nature reserves, protected environments, marine protected areas, mountain catchment areas, specially protected forest areas, and forest nature reserves.6. Cabinet approved South Africa s Negotiating Positions for the 13th Meeting of the Conference of Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (Ramsar COP 13) to be held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, from 21 to 29 October 2018.6.1. The broad objectives of the Ramsar Convention are to ensure the conservation and wise use of all wetlands. In South Africa, wetlands are the most threatened of all ecosystems, with 48% of them critically endangered.6.2. This contributes to water resources management as part of a proactive approach to drought management.C. Bills1. Cabinet approved publication of the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Disease Amendment Bill of 2018 for public comment.1.1. The Bill, which amends the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act, 1993 (Act 130 of 1993) recognises domestic workers, who were excluded from the Act, as employees for the purpose of benefits, as well as improving existing benefits.1.2. The amendments improve the benefits payable to employees and their dependents, and aim to assist injured and diseased employees to be rehabilitated and reintegrated into the workplace and society.2.

The Bill amends the Child Justice Act, 2008 (Act 75 of 2008) in order to review the minimum age of criminal capacity of a child by increasing it from the age of 10 to 12 years. The Bill goes further in upholding the rights of children in conflict with the law.2.2. The Bill also de-links the issue of criminal capacity from diversion, by removing the requirement to prove criminal capacity for purposes of diversion and preliminary inquiries.3. Cabinet approved submission of the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill of 2018 to Parliament.3.1. The Bill, which amends the Civil Aviation Act, 2009 (Act 13 of 2009), will strengthen the aviation safety, security and environmental protection regulatory frameworks to ensure sustainability and stability of the civil-aviation industry.3.2. This will ensure that South Africa continues to meet her international obligations in the civil-aviation arena, which strengthens support to our economic development as a catalyst for increased trade, tourism and job creation.3.3. The Bill also provides for, amongst others, the operational independence of the aircraft accident and incident investigation, and to rectify inconsistencies and shortcomings.D. Upcoming events1.

Cabinet decisionsCabinet approved a revised delivery model on implementation of the Broadcast Digital Migration Project. The model adopts a market/retail-driven approach through collaboration and partnerships with the private sector and industry. With this approach, government will no longer be involved in the procurement of set-top-boxes, warehousing, transportation and installation of devices. This provides South Africa with headway towards the completion of the project in a manner that is inclusive, affordable and efficient, and that reduces risk to government. This will push digital viewership migration to the 85% threshold and beyond, towards switching off all analogue broadcasts.Cabinet approved South Africa s Common Core Document, which will be deposited with the United Nations (UN).

Issues in the environment1. Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS)1.1. Cabinet welcomes the maiden MTBPS by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, which is based on the strong conviction that South Africa can be renewed.1.2. The 2018 MTBPS highlights the difficult economic and fiscal choices confronting government over the next three years. Economic growth for 2018 has been revised down from 1.5% to 0.7%, and the global environment remains challenging for emerging market economies. The 2018 MTBPS gives effect to the President s growth economic stimulus and recovery plan, which will be underpinned by fiscal and monetary stability.1.3. Government remains committed to fiscal sustainability, but there has been slippage since the tabling of the 2018 Budget in February this year.

This shifts communities from subsistence to commercial participants and owners of businesses across the value chains of the assets on their land.3.4. Government is committed to supporting the sustainability of emerging agricultural enterprises, which includes 262 land reform-related projects to benefit youth and women across all provinces.4. Destruction of public infrastructure4.1.  Cabinet expressed concern on the destruction of transport infrastructure.  This undermines government's commitment to take services to historically disadvantaged communities. No amount of unhappiness should result in the destruction of public property. Such destruction serves to rob the poor of much-needed services.4.2. Cabinet calls on members of the public to be vigilant and work with law enforcement agencies to bring those responsible to account. Cabinet further noted that the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster will deal with this matter accordingly. 5. National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) appointment process5.1.

Constitutional Court Judgement6.1 Cabinet deliberated on the Constitutional Court Judgement on the use, cultivation and possession of cannabis by an adult person in private for his/her personal consumption and its impact. Members of the public are requested to familiarise themselves with the judgement as the use of cannabis in a public place is prohibited. Furthermore, the judgement did not decriminalise the dealing in cannabis.6.2 Cabinet acknowledges that the judgement exists in the context of other laws which may be applicable to the use, possession and cultivation of cannabis.  Cabinet is taking advice on the matter.7. School Safety Summit7.1. Cabinet welcomes the recently held School Safety Summit hosted under the leadership of Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga. The summit brought together education and external stakeholders to find solutions to safety issues facing the country s schools as well as to pave the way forward for safer environments in schools.7.2.

All stakeholders agreed that violence in general, and in schools in particular, is not acceptable and that further cooperation is required to ensure that schools become safer for both learners and teachers.8. Matric exams8.1. Cabinet wishes all learners, especially Grade 12 learners, well over this period. For the first time, the department will this year also administer an examination in South African Sign Language at Home Language level to 58 deaf candidates across 10 schools. The examination extends over five-and-a-half weeks and will conclude on 28 November.8.2. Learners across the country will also sign a voluntary pledge to commit to upholding the integrity of the examinations by not participating in any malpractice. Parents and guardians are encouraged to support learners during this critical period in their academic journey. It is also vital to motivate learners to finish their schooling.B. Cabinet decisions9. Cabinet has approved the declaration of 20 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) as part of the Operation Phakisa: Ocean Economy MPAs Representative Network.  The benefit of the additional designation will, amongst others, allow for further development of the ecotourism and promotion of access to sustainably managed resources for small-scale fisheries.

Cabinet approved South Africa s Revised and Aligned Second National Action Programme (NAP) to Combat Desertification, Land Degradation and Mitigate the Effects of Drought (2018-2030). The NAP seeks to contribute towards the conservation and sustainable use of our land and other natural resources.South Africa ratified the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in 1997. In accordance with Article 9 of the convention, parties are required to develop, prepare and implement a NAP as the central element of the strategy to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought. South Africa developed its first NAP in 2004.C. Bills11. Cabinet approved the publication of the Children s Amendment Bill in the Government Gazette for public comments. The Bill seeks to strengthen coordination of the child-care and protection system through interdepartmental and intersectoral collaboration. The amendments respond to the North Gauteng High Court Judgement of November 2017, wherein the Department of Social Development was ordered to prepare and introduce the necessary amendments to the Children s Act, 2005 (Act 38 of 2005) in respect to the legal solution towards the management of the foster-care system.12. Cabinet approved the introduction of the Postal Services Amendment Bill to Parliament. The Bill gives effect to the National Integrated ICT Policy White Paper that was approved by Cabinet in September 2016.The intended outcomes are to have a competitive, viable and sustainable South African Post Office that provides/facilitates universal services and access as well as the transformation of the postal sector.

The Africa Investment Forum was convened by the African Development Bank. It aims to build on current successes by bringing together public and private sector investors to chart a new growth path for the entire African Continent.  2.5.

Statement on the Cabinet Meeting of 27 February 2019,28 Feb 2019,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-27-february-2019-28-feb-2019-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-27-february-2019-28-feb-2019-0000,"Cabinet met on Wednesday, 27 February 2019 at Tuynhuys in Cape Town.A. Issues In The Environment1. 2019 Budget Speech1.1. Cabinet welcomes the 2019 Budget Speech delivered by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni in Parliament, Cape Town on Wednesday, 20 February 2019, as a framework that has set South Africa on a path where together we are enabled to renew and rebuild our economy into an inclusive and thriving one.1.2. The Budget Speech brings into effect the commitments outlined by President Cyril Ramaphosa in his State of the Nation Address in Parliament, Cape Town on 7 February 2019.  1.3. Cabinet supports various initiatives, including cutting the public sector wage bill, in order to generate additional savings to strengthen government s finances. Imposing strict conditions of financial support to Eskom to help the utility restructure into a viable organisation is also welcomed.1.4. We all have a part to play in growing the economy and creating jobs for our people. Overcoming the toughest challenges stemming from the legacy of apartheid means working together  with government to implement its programmes, grow the economy and attract more foreign investment.2. Eskom2.1. Cabinet received a report from Deputy President David Mabuza on the work of the joint Special Cabinet Committee on Eskom that was established in response to recent electricity supply disruptions and the negative impact on the economy.  Government s coordinated efforts to bring financial, operational and structural sustainability to Eskom are proceeding in earnest.2.2. The Special Cabinet Committee is convened by Deputy President Mabuza and includes the Ministers of Public Enterprises, Energy, Transport, Finance, Police and State Security. It will be required to monitor energy supply on a daily basis.2.3. In line with President Ramaphosa s commitment that government s response to the electricity crisis must be inclusive and consultative, the Minister of Public Enterprises and the Eskom board Chairperson had their first preliminary engagements with the leadership of the three labour unions recognized by Eskom, the coal mining industry and the engineering fraternity.2.4. The meeting with labour reported on the problems with Eskom s operations and generation system, maintenance and unplanned outages. The meeting sought to establish a basis for formal future consultations. The restructuring of Eskom was also discussed, and all parties agreed that there would be more interactions to better understand the roadmap and the implications of separating Eskom s business divisions into three separate operating entities.2.5. The coal mining industry was convened under the auspices of the Minerals Council of South Africa (MINCOSA), and the meeting raised problems related to coal supply, costs and pricing, and the quality of coal provided to Eskom.2.6. Further engagements were convened with the engineering fraternity, under the auspices of the Engineering Council of South Africa (ECSA). All engineering specialist disciplines were represented by their respective voluntary associations, including the National Association of Black Engineers.2.7. The ECSA gave its analysis of the problems facing Eskom and provided a set of recommendations about how to involve the broader South African academic and technical professional fraternity in the urgent interventions required to stabilize electricity supply.2.8. MINCOSA and the ECSA will assist government to establish a Technical Operations and Maintenance Review Team for Eskom that will be announced shortly.3. Renewable energy3.1. Cabinet supports the announcements by Energy Minister Jeff Radebe, which reaffirms the basic rationale behind renewable energy in arresting the high negative impact of fossil fuel sources of energy such as oil and coal.3.2. Energy is a key enabler in South Africa s trajectory towards socio- economic growth and development. The National Development Plan (NDP) states that South Africa needs at least 20 000 megawatts of  renewable energy by 2030. The Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme has made a significant impact on the economy, job creation, community upliftment, economic transformation and climate change.3.3. While South Africa continues to make a significant contribution to the global effort for a low-carbon and climate resilient developments, government remains committed to ensuring a responsible and just  transition to a cleaner future.3.4. The World Bank Group recently hosted the South African Renewable Energy and Energy Storage Systems in Cape Town from 25 to 26 February 2019 under the theme:  Batteries, Energy Storage and the Renewable Future   Towards a 100% Dispatchable Renewable Energy System . Delegates from industry, finance, utilities, regulators, government and academia discussed advancements in the renewable-energy sector including policy, regulatory, financial, business, technological, applications, innovation, codes and standards issues that are required for the expansion of renewable energy.3.5. Renewable energy and energy storage technologies enable us to convert electrical power into an energy form and store it for later use when needed. Energy storage systems reduce the need for back-up capacity from coal or gas-fired electrical generation plants, thereby reducing power sector emissions and help us mitigate against climate change.4. Special Economic Zones (SEZs) Programme4.1. Cabinet welcomes local and international investor confidence displayed through investments in the Saldanha Bay Industrial Development Zone (SBIDZ), which is developing into a world-class offshore and martime hub. This is part of the Department of Trade and Industry s SEZ Programme.4.2. The establishment of SEZs countrywide is reversing the concentration of economic activity to certain areas of the country as a result of apartheid spatial planning.4.3. Since their establishment, SEZs have contributed to attracting foreign direct investment such as the recently signed a R3-billion investment at the SBIDZ.4.4. The SBIDZ s investment pipeline includes at least five more investments that will add another R2.4 billion of investment to the short and medium-term outlook of the zone, once completed.5. Water supply5.1. Cabinet welcomes the  Mzimvubu Water Project s advanced infrastructure at Esiqhungqwini village in Tsolo, situated in Mhlontlo Local Municipality in the Eastern Cape, as an example of how government continues to meet the needs of communities despite South Africa being a water-stressed country 5.2. The realisation of such water projects create job opportunities and ensure potable water supply for domestic and industrial use.   5.3. Since the advent of democracy much work has been done to ensure that communities have access to basic services like clean water. Nearly 90% of households currently have access to piped water.  6. School safety6.1. Cabinet condemns reported incidents of bullying, robberies and violence in some of the country s schools. Our children need safe environments of learning and we call on learners, educators, parents and guardians to work together to protect our children socially, physically and emotionally.6.2. Cabinet also commends the South African Police Service for their swift apprehension of suspects involved in an attempted hijacking at an Edenvale school in Gauteng.6.3. Cabinet makes a special appeal to school governing bodies to assess the existing infrastructure of their schools to ensure that school buildings are safe, regularly maintained and conducive to learning.7. Unacceptable practices by some religious leaders7.1. Cabinet noted with concern recent media reports about certain unacceptable practices by some religious leaders.  The recent purported resurrection of a deceased person is a case in point. More of such  incidences have happened in the recent past, ranging from spraying of congregants with poisonous insecticides to encouraging them to consume vehicle fuel, rats and grass, among others.7.2. People approach religious institutions to gain spiritual fulfilment and psychological strength, especially when they are at their lowest and most vulnerable state. Cabinet calls on all people to work together to stop these practices which abuse people s vulnerability and endanger their lives. The law-enforcement agencies should intervene where acts of criminality have been committed under the guise of religion. Cabinet has also noted that the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities is investigating these practices, which will provide a more comprehensive intervention that will stop them.8. 2019 national and provincial elections8.1. Cabinet calls on all eligible South Africans, especially young first time voters who have registered in their thousands, to exercise their right to vote in the upcoming National and Provincial Elections on Wednesday, 8 May 2019, and have a say in the future of the country.8.2. President Ramaphosa has officially proclaimed and gazetted the 8 May 2019 as the date for the national and provincial elections. This means the voters  roll is now officially closed and people will no longer be able to register to vote  in the May elections. The President has also in terms of Section 2A of the Public Holidays Act, 1994 (Act 36 of 1994), as amended, declared 8 May 2019 as a public holiday throughout the country.8.3. In South Africa, the right to vote is a culmination of years of struggle for our freedom. It came at a huge cost with countless of our country men andwomen sacrificing their lives.9. Caster Semenya9.1. Cabinet joins the rest of South Africa in standing united behind our golden girl Caster Semenya. Her case, which is being heard before the Court of Arbitration for Sport, is more than just a sporting matter. It is about fundamental human rights and the inherent dignity of all people.9.2. We call on people to show their support at #HandsOffCaster. Let us show the world that we are a nation which values fairness, equality and respect for human dignity.10. Creative industry10.1. Cabinet is pleased with the positive outcomes of the Creative Industry interaction led by Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, held under the Theme:  Leveraging on Digital Platforms for Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) Creatives . The purpose was to engage the industry to assess the impact of the 4IR on the creative sector, and within  the broadcasting and audio-visual sector, and to develop formal stakeholder platforms towards its transformation.10.2. Participants agreed that government should engage stakeholders and Parliament on the Copyright Amendment Bill, development of the Media Transformation Charter, engage broadcasters in an endeavour to curbexploitation of small and independent producers, and ensure that content owners duly benefit from their content being used on online platforms.11. Fake social media accounts11.1. Cabinet notes with concern fake LinkedIn and Facebook accounts which claim to be that of Ministers and Deputy Ministers.11.2. We wish to warn members of the public not to be misled and drawn in by these fake accounts, some of which promise fake business opportunities, and which requests people to pay money to be part of these businessopportunities. No member of the Executive solicits payments for any official transactions via social media. In cases of doubt, please contact the various ministries or departments at www.gov.za.11.3. Members of the public are urged to exercise caution and those who fell prey to these impersonators should immediately report it to the police.11.4. Cabinet condemns activities performed in the name of members of the Executive or any other member of society through fake social media accounts.11.5. We distance ourselves from the comments, views and photographs purported by these fake accounts.12. Venezuela12.1. Cabinet is concerned about the unfolding situation in Venezuela, especially the humanitarian challenges that require urgent attention. We commend efforts by the United Nations (UN) to provide humanitariansupport to locals and call on the the international community to support the people of Venezuela during this difficult time.12.2. Cabinet further supports calls for the people of Venezuela to be afforded the opportunity to decide their own future. Drawing from our own  experience in South Africa, we believe that a permanent solution can only be achieved from internal and inclusive political dialogue involving all affected parties in that country.B. Cabinet Decisions13. National Action Plan (NAP) to Combat Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance13.1. Since 1994, successive administrations have worked to unite all our people, foster national unity and ensure greater social cohesion.  Healing the divisions of the past is a continuous process that must go hand in hand  with ensuring greater economic opportunities for more people. Cabinet has therefore approved the NAP to Combat Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance for tabling at theUN.13.2. This follows extensive consultations with government departments, Chapter Nine institutions, civil-society organisations and relevant stakeholders in all provinces.13.3. The NAP will contribute to and ensure government s compliance with its  international, regional and national obligations, specifically the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the UN following the 3rd World Conference against Racism (WCAR) held in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal in 2001.14. Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment14.1. Cabinet approved submission of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to Parliament for ratification in terms ofSection 231(2) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996.14.2. Ratification promotes constitutionalism, human rights and is in accordance with South Africa s international obligations. The Constitution provides for the prevention of the violation of the rights of person held inplaces of detention through state sanction or court order.15. Designs of the commemorative collectors coin series15.1. Cabinet approved the designs of the commemorative collectors  coinseries to be issued in 2019-2021:a) 2019  Celebrating South Africa  coin series: 25 Years of a Constitutional Democracy;b) 2019-2021 pure-gold coin series: Africa s Big Five;c) 2019-2021 platinum coin series: Africa s Big Five;d) 2020 Natura coin series: the Supercontinent Gondwana;e) 2020 Natura coin series: R25 fine-silver coin: Cradle of Humankind   Hominids;f) 2020 2 c tickey and R2 crown series: South African Inventions   Retinal Cryoprobe;g) 2020 R10 and R5 colour coin series: Birds and Flowers of the Cape Winelands Biosphere Reserve; andh) 2021 Natura coin series: R25 fine-silver coin: the Supercontinent Gondwana.C. Bills16. Tourism Amendment Bill16.1. Tourism is a sector that holds the promise of incredible opportunities and must be nurtured to grow and further develop. The NDP recognises that tourism has the potential to become one of the main drivers in the economy.16.2 In further pursuing the country s tourism potential as a significant generator of jobs and revenue, Cabinet approved the publication of the Tourism Amendment Bill for public comment, which amends the Tourism Act, 2014 (Act 3 of 2014).16.3. The amendments improve the governance of South African Tourism as an entity under the authority of a board. It also empowers the Minister of Tourism to determine the thresholds regarding short-term home rental.16.4. The Bill also provides for the competence requirements of tourist guides and for the regulation of tourist guide driving.17. Central Application Service Bill of 201917.1. As a nation we are committed to opening up and ensuring wider access  to the post-school education and training system. A crucial part of this process lies in ensuring that prospective students have access to a single, affordable and easy-to-understand application system which covers multiple institutions of higher learning. To this effect, Cabinet approved publication of the Central Application Service Bill of 2019 in the Government Gazette, for public comment.17.2. The Bill provides for the establishment of a public entity that will streamline applications into higher education and training programmes, reduce the cost of application, provide applicants with information on academic programmes and enable the Department of Higher Education and Training and institutions of higher learning to monitor equity and demographics.18. African Public Library and Information Services Bill of 201918.1. In pursuit of a culture of a reading nation, Cabinet has approved the publication of South African Public Library and Information Services Bill of 2019 for public comment. The Bill seeks to address the transformational issues in providing public libraries with the communities particularly those previously disadvantaged communities.18.2. Cognisance of the fact that the provision of public libraries in terms of the Constitution is a competence of the municipalities. This Bill, amongst others, provides the norms and standards of the ideal public library. It also promotes cooperative governance and coordination across the three spheres of government regarding public library and information services.  18.3. Once the Bill is approved, it will address the historical inequalities in respect of public libraries and provide for sufficient accommodating resources for impaired persons, youth, elderly and non-English speakers  in urban and rural areas.

Issues in the environment1. Good Green Deeds1.1. Cabinet thanks all South Africans who joined President Cyril Ramaphosa in the launch of the national Good Green Deeds campaign.

South Africa is one of the signatories to the Paris Agreement on climate change which guides the international efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. 1.2.

A well-managed environment will contribute in reducing the greenhouse gas emissions, contribute towards food security, water, energy and general livelihoods. 1.3. Cabinet calls on everyone to make the Good Green Deeds campaign a way of living so that our neighborhoods, communities and the country can become a global example of being clean, green and habitable. 2. Land Claims2.1. Cabinet is pleased with the continued roll out programme of land reforms that seek to correct the wrongs of the past and build a more equitable society that will benefit all South Africans. 2.2. In advancing the equitable distribution of land, President Ramaphosa led the handover of the settled and finalised 142 hectares of prime land claims to the community of Moretele, who indicated that they will use the land for development. 2.3. These communities lost their rights to land when they were abruptly removed from their properties following the implementation of the provisions of the Natives Land Act of 1913. The Commission on Restitution of Land Rights (CRLR) has spent over R203 million in settling and finalising the claims.3. Eskom3.1. Cabinet received a report from Deputy President David Mabuza on the work of the joint Special Cabinet Committee on Eskom that was established in response to recent, electricity supply disruptions and its negative impact on the economy.  Government s coordinated efforts to bring financial, operational and structural sustainability to Eskom are proceeding in earnest.3.2. The Eskom Technical Review Team appointed by the Minister of Public Enterprises and the Board of Eskom started its work this week. It is expected to produce a preliminary report within four (4) weeks. The performance of the power plants remain volatile even though load-shedding has not been implemented since 15 February 2019.There has been a number of major incidents in the distribution areas that have contributed to the power disruptions3.3. Cabinet noted the good progress that has been made with the recovery of coal stocks across the power stations, but further attention must be given to the Coal Supply Chain.

Cabinet also welcomes Chinese electronics manufacturer Hisense s R72-million investment into its refrigeration and television production lines at its Atlantis factory in the Western Cape, which created 150 manufacturing job opportunities.

Quarterly Labour Survey3.1 Cabinet welcomes the release this week of the latest employment data from StatsSA, which confirm the growth in total employment during 2018. The Quarterly Employment Survey (QES), one of two surveys conducted by StatsSA, showed that employment in the formal sector grew by 158 000 during the 12 months of 2018. During the last three months of last year, employment grew by 87 000. The survey excludes data on agriculture and the informal economy.3.2 This welcome trend follows the release last month of the more comprehensive Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS), which covers all sectors of the economy, both formal and informal, and which also showed significant employment growth during 2018.3.3 This increase in jobs reflect in part growing investor confidence and a rise in foreign direct investment in the economy, pointing to the success of the President s efforts to boost South Africa as a destination for investment. The Presidential Investment Conference held in October last year attracted pledges of R300 billion. Over the next four years, Government will work with investors, local communities and organized labour to enable the pledged investment to take place and to help create additional jobs and economic opportunities.3.4 Since the start of the current Administration, the QLFS shows that total employment has grown to 16, 5 million, with 1, 5 million new jobs created in the 5-year period.4.

Cabinet also thanks non-governmental organisations and the Gift of the Givers for providing ongoing humanitarian and disaster-relief assistance.5. Eskom5.1.

Good progress has since been made in acquiring sufficient coal and diesel supplies, and with water reserves at pumped storage stations at hydro-electricity plants.5.2. The Technical Review Panel that was appointed by Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and the Eskom Board on 4 March 2019, will finish some of its work by early next week and will have some preliminary results from its review of Eskom power stations. This will assist Eskom and government to put in place a more rigorous programme of power-plant maintenance, which will help stabilise the generation system over the next few weeks and months. 5.3. Cabinet also dealt with the financial situation of Eskom. Further options are being considered to support the power utility. Electricity generation has been stable this week with a low risk of load-shedding.  However, there are still a high number of unplanned outages that create a disruptive effect on the overall system.5.4. Cabinet commended the Eskom management and staff for their efforts to provide stable, consistent and reliable energy supply both to our economy and to our citizens under difficult operating conditions.5.5. Cabinet emphasised that all South Africans should cooperate and come up with new ideas   as well as energy-saving practices that were applied in the past   to reduce the demand for electricity.

He brings to SARS a wealth of managerial experience which he acquired from both the private and public sector. The conclusion of this appointment gives effect to the recommendation made by the Commission of Inquiry into Tax Administration and Governance by SARS, chaired by retired Judge Robert Nugent.11.  Commission of Inquiry into Tax Administration and Governance by SARS (Nugent Report)11.1. Cabinet was briefed on the outcome of the work of the Commission of Inquiry into Tax Administration and Governance by SARS. President Ramaphosa appointed the commission on the 24 May 2018to, among others, stabilise SARS, restore its credibility and strengthen its capacity to meet revenue targets. Its interim report was submitted on 27 September 2018 and the final report on 11 December 2018. 11.2. Cabinet noted the findings of the commission most failings at SARS stemmed from a  massive failure of governance and integrity  under the former Commissioner.  The commission made 27 specific corrective recommendations to rectify past harmful decisions, covering an array of areas which included procurement, organizational design and strengthening of the organisational leadership. One of the key recommendations has been the urgent appointment of the Commissioner for SARS.11.3. Cabinet expresses its broad support for the recommendations made by the Commission and the Minister of Finance will oversee the implementation of its recommendations, including leading a consultative process to amend the SARS Act to improve governance and accountability, and the potential role of an Inspector General compared to a Board.11.4.

The report has been public since its release, and is available on the Presidency website.12. Evaluation of the National Drug Master Plan (NDMP) 2013-201812.1. Cabinet approved the evaluation report of the NDMP 2013-2018 as a demonstration of government s continued commitment to fight the use and effects of drugs within communities around the country.12.2. The evaluation establishes that whilst the NDMP provides a guiding framework for the sector, its implementation has been weakened by poor alignment of the strategies of the various relevant departments. 12.3. It proposes a number of interventions such as harmonizing the strategies of the departments and further recommends a more independent fully funded structure to drive the substance abuse and prevention in our communities, especially amongst the youth.12.4. Cabinet acknowledges the challenges faced by our communities in respect of drug addiction. The recommendation made by this evaluation will go a long way in decisively addressing this issue. Cabinet also approved the setting up of an Anti-Drug Council, structured similarly to the South African National AIDS Council, to drive the fight against drug addiction. The revised master plan will now be referred to as Anti-Drug Master Plan.13. Framework on Gender Responsive Planning, Budgeting, Monitoring Evaluation and Audit13.1. Cabinet approved the Framework on Gender Responsive Planning, Budgeting, Monitoring Evaluation and Audit. The framework places gender mainstreaming at the centre of public policy by putting forward a strategy and implementation plan towards gender responsiveness of existing planning, budgeting, monitoring, evaluations and auditing systems.13.2. The constitutional mandate to end gender discrimination, and realise the rights of women and girls, requires a decisive and effective paradigm shift across all state machinery.14. Evaluation reports14.1. Cabinet also approved a number of other evaluation reports that were commissioned through the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) including the following:The Evaluation of the Framework for Strategic and Annual  Performance Plans (FSAPP) which determines whether FSAPP has  been effective at guiding departments in their service delivery, particularly  responding to government s priority outcomes, and in holding  departments accountable for performance. The review confirms the  relevance of this approach, however it indicates that the design has some  gaps and that the approach is not entirely aligned, coherent and consistent  with all the related policies and legislation.  The report proposes a number  of interventions to strengthen this approach.The Evaluation of Design Draft Policy on Community Colleges, which looks at the design of the draft policy to address the lack of education and training opportunities for adults and post-school youth and the failure of them to meet the needs of adult and youth to access the labour market and livelihood skills. The evaluation report highlights the absence of adequate resources to enable this programme to derive the anticipated outcomes. The Evaluation of Government Business Incentives, which provides an assessment of how the system as a whole is working to support  business and benefit society. Government uses a wide range of incentives to encourage firms to act or invest in specific activities or contribute to certain social or economic outcomes. The report identifies overlaps and complementaries in various business incentives. It recommends amongst others the establishment of an Intergovernmental Incentive co-ordination committee.The Evaluation of the Integrated Strategy on the Promotion of Entrepreneurship and Small Enterprises, which assessed the effectiveness of implementation of this strategy, which was approved in 2005 to focus on critical areas such as job creation, equity and access to  markets. These enterprises play a critical role in creating employment, innovation and growth.  The proposed improvement plan includes improvement, coordination and rationalization across all spheres of government and strengthen institutional governance and oversight.14.2. The evaluations seek to strengthen the Public Service and governance of government. The evaluations were commissioned to independent service providers and will be posted on the DPME website: www.dpme.gov.za.15.  National coordinating mechanism for UN, AU and the SADC15.1. In line with the National Development Plan, which seeks to promote sustainable development by tackling regional, continental and global challenges, Cabinet approved the establishment of a national coordinating mechanism to coordinate the sustainable development agendas of the UN, AU and the SADC.15.2.  This national coordination mechanism will serve as a multi-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder process to facilitate consultations and coordination within and outside government on South Africa s international sustainable development commitments.15.3.  This will be overseen by an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC), driven from the centre of government, which will ensure that the development agendas (UN s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the AU s Agenda 2063 and the SADC s Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan) are fully reflected in the country s national plans, and will provide overall guidance on fulfilling monitoring and reporting requirements.16. IMC on the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR)16.1. Subsequent to President Ramaphosa s announcement in his 2019 State of the Nation Address, Cabinet approved the establishment of an IMC on the 4IR.16.2. The commission is to advise on strategies and policies to respond to new technological developments occasioned by digitisation and the 4IR.

As Cabinet concludes its programme of this fifth administration, it thanked social partners and citizens. It called on South Africans to remain resolute in building a prosperous country.17.2.

Issues in the environment 1. State of the Nation Address (SoNA) 1.1. President Cyril Ramaphosa s first SoNA of the sixth democratic administration last week, inspired and galvanized all South Africans to work towards a shared prosperous future. SoNA 2019 charts the course for the implementation of the electoral mandate received by the governing party from our people.1.2. This sets out how working together, we will improve the lives of South Africans and grow the economy for our country, by addressing the persistent realities of unemployment, poverty and inequality. President Ramaphosa s call for a new social compact requires the contribution of all South Africans working together to overcome our challenges and place the country on a path of greater growth.1.3. This includes expanding the industrial sector, strengthening the mining industry, supporting the agricultural sector, improving the skills base of our youth and making it easier for tourists to visit the country. As South Africans, we must continue to encourage and support local industries and buy local products.1.4. The hard work that government will undertake is anchored in seven key priorities that it will pursue over the next five years, and give effect to the National Development Plan (NDP) and our drive to attain Vision 2030.1.5. The debate on SoNA has highlighted the significance of  us reparing the economy and reparing the broken parts of our state machinery in the implementation of the electoral mandate. This will lead us to achieve the South Africa we want and the South Africa of our dreams as encapsulated in Vision 2030 of the NDP.1.6. Cabinet calls on all social partners, business, labour, civil society and political formations, to reinforce their collaborative efforts in making our country a better place for all and take shared responsibility for accelerating the country s growth trajectory.1.7. On our part as government we will redouble and triple our endevours as directed by the President to remove an impediments to the growth of our economy and build the capacity of our state organs to deliver to our people. During July, respective Ministers will table their Budget Vote statements, in which practical plans will further be unveiled in order to realise the vision that the President has put before the nation. 2. Youth Month 2.1. The June Youth Month is a stark reminder of the role played by our youth in creating conditions that led to our freedom. The President s SoNA puts the growing of the economy and the creation of jobs for our young people at the epicenter of the Sixth administration s work. The President engaged with various sectors of young people including those living with disabilities, youth in business, in the arts environment and academia prior to his SoNA organised by the National Youth Development Agency under the theme:  25 years of democracy   celebrating youth activism . This Presidential Youth Dialogue reaffirmed the continued difficulties and challenges faced by our youth that needs urgent intervention by our government.2.2. In this regard we want to confirm that various government programmes, including the Department of Basic Education s Second Chance Programme, the National Youth Service and the Youth Employment Service initiative, go a long way in preparing our youth for the work environment.2.3. We nonetherless need to double and triple our efforts as a country in creating the much needed jobs for our young people. For us to do so it is incumbent upon us to ignite the growth of our economy as directed by our President. We know it will not be easy, we know there will not be quick solutions turning around the economy but we also know that it must be done for the sake of our country and our youth.2.4. Cabinet calls on all sectors to take their cue from the President and to actively engage young people in working together to find practical solutions to challenges they experience. We will also do our part in improving the performance of our economy to create jobs for our young people.3. Reconfiguration of government 3.1. South Africans have given this sixth administration a clear mandate to accelerate inclusive economic growth, act with greater urgency to tackle poverty, improve government services, fight corruption and end state capture.3.2. Cabinet confirms that the macro reorganization of government will streamline and improve service delivery to our people through a seamless, cost-effective and efficient government that is more responsive to the needs of South Africans.4. Trade agreements4.1. Cabinet welcomed the signing of ninty-three (93) agreements between South African suppliers and Chinese companies, to buy local products for export to China, with a contract value calculated at R27 billion, which will strengthen growth and the creation of jobs.In addition to that, one of the agreements signed was an investment agreement that covers the Beijing Auto Industrial Cooperation s investment in the auto-manufacturing plant in the industrial development zone of Coega. It is an investment to build vehicles in South Africa for the South African market but also for markets elsewhere. These deals are part of commitments which came out of the existing comprehensive strategic partnership agreement of 2010, and the eight major commitments made at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.5. Quarterly employment statistics5.1. The Statistics South Africa released the Quarterly Employment Survey for the first quarter of 2019 in the past week.5.2. Findings show an increase of 22 000 jobs (+0.2%) from 10 152 000 to 10 174 000 in the formal non-agricultural business sector. This was largely due to increases in the following industries: community services, mining and quarrying, manufacturing and business services.5.3. Total employment increased by 76 000 or 0,8% year-on-year between March 2018 and March 2019. 5.4.  Cabinet notes this favourable development but remains convinced that there is still a long way to go to improve the performance of all sectors of our economy and create the much needed jobs in our country.  To this end Cabinet commits to work with all sectors of our South African society including the private sector.6. Tax Season6.1. The revenue generated from income tax ensures government has the capacity to provide much-needed services and social support to millions of less fortunate communities.6.2. Cabinet encourages South Africans to prepare their tax submission for the 2018/19 tax season. Appropriate and efficient revenue collection enables government to ensure fiscal sovereignty.6.3. Taxpayers who are registered for eFiling or use the new South African Revenue Service s MobiApp can file their income tax returns from 1 July 2019. South Africans who earn less than R500 000 per year and meet certain other criteria, do not need to file tax returns.7. Crime fighting7.1. Cabinet has noted with concern the spate of the killing of members from law-enforcement officers. In September 2018, twenty-eight (28) members of the police were reported to have been killed. Since the beginning of 2019, twenty-six (26) police officers have been killed. 7.2. The most recent cases being that of Sergeant Zephania Dladla, Constable Nomasonto Mhlanga and Constable Nhlamulo Vukeya. Cabinet extends its deepest condolences to their families, friends and colleagues.7.3. Cabinet condemns in the strongest possible terms these attacks and killings.

We all have to work together with law-enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators of these heinous crimes are arrested and face the full might of the law.7.4. Cabinet commends the justice system that has resulted in nine perpetrators of these crimes being handed life sentences, in this year alone.8. Mozambique Border shooting incident8.1.

The team is on a fact-finding mission into the shooting incident. They are expected to, amongst others, discuss a joint investigation team between Mozambique and South Africa.8.4.

Cabinet appeals to all the parties to support the resumption of the Parliament that will ensure the adoption of the agreement.3. Destruction of public property3.1.

No measure of grievance justifies the destruction of a public property such as a school, which serves as a critical stepping stone towards building the future of our children.3.2. Over the past 25 years, government has invested billions of rands in the construction of new schools and upgrading of existing school infrastructure. This year, government has allocated around R30 billion to build new schools and maintain existing infrastructure.3.3.

It also calls on community members to work with police to ensure that people who destroy public property are arrested.4. Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA) Report4.1. Cabinet is concerned about the audit outcomes of municipalities released by the AGSA recently. The unacceptably high levels of poor governance, particularly the management of public funds in a number of municipalities, suggest ineffective and poor execution of service-delivery programmes.4.2. The Public Audit Amendment Act, 2018 (Act 5 of 2018), gives the AGSA the authority to hold those found responsible for poor financial management accountable and to curb the abuse of state resources, especially in municipalities which have consistently shown no improvement in their respective outcomes.4.3. Additionally, working through the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, and National Treasury, Cabinet endorses the Back to Basics implementation plan which drives capacity-building in municipalities. The plan, amongst others, seeks to build the competency of personnel through training and skills transfer, and the enforcement of minimum compliance standards for municipal managers and senior officials.4.4. Working with the provincial leadership, Minister Dlamini Zuma will continue to provide the necessary support to municipalities.5. Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR)5.1.

President Ramaphosa, future forecaster George Friedman, labour, academia and civil society attended the summit, which stimulated dialogue, understanding and action plans that will position South Africa as a competitive global player.5.2. Cabinet also welcomes the plans by Google to build a new undersea cable from Portugal to South Africa that will deliver 20 times more network capacity, ensuring faster Internet service. The cable is expected to be completed in 2021. Such interventions will contribute towards making South Africa conducive to potential domestic and international investors.6. Energy6.1. Cabinet welcomes Eskom s announcement that Unit 3 of the Medupi Power Station near Lephalale in Limpopo has reached commercial operation and has been synchronised into the national grid.6.2. This will provide an additional capacity of 796 megawatts. The World Bank has also expressed confidence in government s efforts to support Eskom.6.3. While we continue to support Eskom, Cabinet calls on South Africans to continue to use electricity efficiently, particularly between 17:00 and 21:00, when energy demand from households is at its highest in the country.7. Crime7.1. Cabinet expressed shock and dismay following the murder of at least  13 people in Phillippi, in Cape Town, at the weekend.

Outbreak of African swine fever 8.1. Cabinet applauds the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development for responding swiftly to the outbreak of swine fever reported in North West, Gauteng, Free State and Mpumalanga. This has helped to contain the spread of the disease. Whilst the African swine fever does not affect humans, any meat and products from affected pigs can be a source of infection to other pigs. 8.2. Cabinet urges all farmers in the affected areas to remain vigilant and report any symptoms of the disease amongst their animals.9. Safety in healthcare institutions9.1. Cabinet has expressed the importance of the safety of healthcare workers and patients. This follows the recent reported incidences of attacks of medical emergency service workers when they responded to an emergency call. From January 2019, a total of 10 incidences of such attacks have been reported, the most recent being from Cosmo City Extension 2 in Johannesburg. Cabinet calls on law-enforcement agencies working with the public health institutions to strengthen safety and security at these facilities and also in the transportation of patients. 9.2. Cabinet also urges all healthcare workers to always uphold their professional standards towards patients in their care.10. Gauteng freeway electronic tolling (e-tolling)10.1. President Ramaphosa has mandated Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni and Gauteng Premier David Makhura to find a solution to the e-tolling on Gauteng freeways.10.2. The consultations within government over the coming weeks are expected to produce workable outcomes, which will be submitted to Cabinet by the end of August 2019.10.3. A united response across government is required on issues such as e-tolling to ensure South Africans have confidence in the work of government.11. Budget votes11.1. During July 2019, departments are tabling their budget votes, which provide concrete financial plans on the commitments highlighted by President Ramaphosa in his first State of the Nation Address of the sixth democratic administration.11.2. The budget votes provide a detailed account of departments  respective plans for the year, which give effect to the 2019-2024 Medium Term Strategic Framework.11.3. Cabinet encourages citizens to engage with the budget votes and hold departments to account. Budget votes ensure that public funds are spent according to government s priorities and in ways that will most benefit South Africans.B. Cabinet decisions1.1.

South Africa is amongst the hundred and ninety-three  (193) UN member states that officially adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In 2017, South Africa became one of the 51 countries that volunteered to submit their progress report to the UN.1.2. South Africa s National Development Plan (NDP), AU s Agenda 2063 and the UN s SDGs all mutually reinforce the developmental agenda of South Africa and the African continent.1.3. The progress report was compiled in consultation with a number of stakeholders, including civil-society organisations, private sector and the academia. The report further highlights areas that remain a challenge. Once it has been submitted, it will be accessible through the UN website (https://www.un.org/en/).C. Bills1.1. Cabinet approved the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill of 2018 for tabling in Parliament. In 2018, Cabinet approved that the Bill be released for public consultation over a three-month period, from June to September 2018. The inputs received from this process have been incorporated into this latest version, which will be subjected to another rigorous parliamentary process.1.2. The Bill will give effect to the NDP that seeks to provide for universal quality healthcare services to all South Africans, irrespective of their socio-economic background. It will be based on values of justice, fairness and social solidarity. It will address the current health system that serves only 16% of South Africans whilst excluding the overwhelming majority.1.3. The NHI Bill provides for the establishment of the NHI Fund as a public entity reporting to the Minister of Health. It will be established as an autonomous schedule 3A under the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act 1 of 1999).1.4. Once the Bill has been passed, the existing draft implementation plan will be amended accordingly to give effect to the transitional arrangement of rolling out the NHI in phases. The transition period will also allow for the repeal of certain pieces of legislation to enable alignment and coherence.1.5. The Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize, will hold a separate media briefing to unpack the Bill.D. Upcoming events1.1. President Ramaphosa will on Tuesday, 23 July 2019 lead the government delegation to the two-day  25 Years of Democracy   The Next 25 Years  Conference at the University of Johannesburg (UJ).

This protest became a turning point in our struggle for freedom and a democratic society. 3.3 Despite our remarkable achievement in advancing the emancipation of women in our society, the scourge of violence and abuse of women in our nation persists. The hefty sentences handed down in Gauteng sexual violence cases show that perpetrators of sexual crimes and other related offences will not escape the course of justice.3.4 . Cabinet calls on all sectors of society to oppose any violence, and make a collective effort to reduce the number of sexual offences and attacks on women and children towards the total eradication of these vices.E. Messages 1. Condolences1.1. Cabinet mourns the loss of veteran freedom fighter Ntate Isaac Lesibe  Bra Ike  Maphoto, who passed on at the age of 88.

National Economic Development and Labour Council (NEDLAC)  commitments1.1. Cabinet remains concerned about the high levels of unemployment and the low economic growth figures in our country. The results of the Quarterly Labour Force Survey for the second quarter of 2019 released by Statistics South Africa, indicate that the official unemployment rate increased by 1,4 percentage points to 29,0% compared to the first quarter of 2019. 1.2. Cabinet remains committed to addressing structural challenges that continue to affect the performance of our economy and its ability to respond to developmental challenges. 1.3.

AGOA is a unilateral US trade preference programme that provides duty-free quota-free treatment for over 6 400 tariff lines from 40 AGOA-eligible sub-Saharan African countries, including South Africa, into the US market.3.3. South Africa s constructive and positive discussions with the US Trade Representative provides potential access to the US market and American investment in our economy, which are important ways of addressing job creation and the elimination of poverty. 4. Attacks on South African Police Service (SAPS) members 4.1. The recent attacks on members of the SAPS in the line of duty in the City of Johannesburg should not be tolerated. Cabinet condemns the attacks in the strongest possible terms and have instructed our police and other law-enforcement agencies to pursue the suspects without any fear or favour. 4.2. The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996 directs that the law-enforcement agencies, inclusive of our police service, must prevent, combat and investigate crime, maintain public order, protect and secure its inhabitants and their respective properties and uphold and enforce the law. 4.3. Any attack on our law-enforcement officers is an attack on our state and its sovereignty, such attacks should not go unpunished. We call on all communities to support our government agencies, particularly those enforcing our laws and also unite against this banditry actions that seek to attack police officers. 4.4. Cabinet calls on the law-enforcement agencies to continue to enforce the law and act decisively to those who violate the laws of our country. Municipal by-laws must at all times be adhered to and we call on all our municipalities to enforce our municipal by-laws. We remain a law-abiding country that will continue to ensure peace, stability and prosperity for its citizens. 4.5. Cabinet expects all who live or work in South Africa to collaborate with our law-enforcement agencies to combat criminal and illegal activities.4.6. Cabinet reassures the nation that the country s law-enforcement agencies will act decisively and arrest people who perpetrate lawlessness and violence.   5. Destruction of public property5.1. Cabinet welcomes the end of the recent strike in the City of Tshwane. However, it is highly regrettable that bus drivers blocked major routes into the city with municipal buses, and some of the strikers vandalised infrastructure and reportedly intimidated members of the public.  5.2. Cabinet is concerned about the growing incidents of destruction of public property that accompany protest and strike action in the country. The right to protest is protected and enshrined in the Constitution, and there are many peaceful ways to address public grievances without destroying public services and property. Restoring damaged infrastructure has huge financial and social implications, which negatively impact on citizens who use such amenities daily.6. Silicosis settlement6.1. Cabinet noted the R5-billion historic settlement approved by the Gauteng High Court, which sends a strong message to mining companies to prioritise the safety of workers to prevent diseases that could potentially occur long after their retirement.6.2. The High Court judgement will result in thousands of former mineworkers being compensated for the pain and suffering they endured after contracting diseases linked to prolonged periods working in the gold mines.  6.3. Cabinet also commended the legal teams, including the legal aid, which represented various parties in the lengthy case that settled on compensating the former mineworkers or their eligible heirs, on the part of mine workers who have departed, after they suffered from silicosis or certain types of tuberculosis contracted at certain gold mines after 12 March 1965.6.4. Six gold mining companies   African Rainbow Minerals, Anglo American, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Harmony and Sibanye-Stillwaters   along with the claimants  attorneys, will set up the Tshiamiso Trust, which will ensure qualifying miners or their eligible heirs receive the compensation.7. Mozambique Accord7.1. Cabinet welcomes the signing of the Peace and Reconciliation Agreement in Mozambique on Tuesday, 6 August 2019, as a sign of solidarity with the people of Mozambique, and in support of peace and stability in the country.7.2. The agreement follows the successful political dialogue between the Government of Mozambique and the Mozambican National Resistance Movement, which culminated in the signing of an agreement on definitive cessation of military hostilities on 1 August 2019.7.3.  South Africa and Mozambique share cordial and fraternal bilateral, political, economic and social relations underpinned by strong historical ties dating back from the years of the liberation struggle. President Ramaphosa and many other Heads of State from SADC attended the signing ceremony.8. Caster Semenya8.1. Cabinet is disappointed that our star athlete, Caster Semenya, will not be allowed to defend her world 800m title at the World Championships in Doha, Qatar. This follows a ruling by a Swiss court that supported the International Association of Athletics Federation rule that would require her to take testosterone-reducing medication.8.2. Cabinet fully supports Ms Semenya as she appeals and fights for her fundamental human rights. Like all other athletes, she is entitled to compete without being obliged to alter her body by any medical means.9. National Orders9.1. Cabinet calls on South Africans to nominate persons they deem deserving of being bestowed with the country s highest honours, the National Orders.9.2. These awards honour South Africans and eminent foreign nationals who have contributed to the achievement of a free, united, non-racial, non-sexist, prosperous and democratic South Africa in various ways.9.3.

According to the World Health Organisation, South Africa is classified as one of the low-risk countries in Africa.1.3.  Cabinet was also briefed on the state of readiness to deal with cases of Ebola that may arise in our country. Three separate risk assessments undertaken have confirmed the low risk Ebola profile status of South Africa. Critical health contingency measures have been implemented in our country including the designation of identified hospitals in all our provinces in the eventuality of us having to deal with Ebola. Apart from hospitals identified, the contingency measures include screening facilities in the ports of entry, communication and coordination as well as designated laboratories. 1.4.  Cabinet endorsed the contingency measures that have been put in place to ensure the country respond in the event the disease is picked up. We nonetheless want to assure the country that South Africa remains a low Ebola risk country. C. Upcoming Events1. National Women s Day1.1.

Statement on the Cabinet Meeting of 4 September 2019,6 Sep 2019,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-4-september-2019-6-sep-2019-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-4-september-2019-6-sep-2019-0000,"Cabinet met on Wednesday, 4 September 2019 at Tuynhuys in Cape TownA. Current affairsBased on an analysis of the current affairs environment, the following was agreed by Cabinet: 1. Gender-Based Violence (GBV)1.1.  Cabinet joins the nation in mourning the killings, rape and abuse of women by men that continue to take place in our country. These horrific attacks on women reflects our collective failure to respond to the cries of the most vulnerable in our midst. 1.2.  At its core is the manifestation of a profound lack of adequate response to the continued daily violation of babies, children, the elderly, women living with disabilities, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/transsexual, intersex and queer/questioning community and migrant women. 1.3.  Cabinet has called for the imposition of the maximum sentence to the perpetrators. Notwithstanding the fact that there is a high conviction rate (74%) of GBV and over 4 000 perpetrators who have received life sentences, more still needs to be done. One women killed, raped and abused is one too many. 1.4. The national Register of Sexual Offences will be placed before Parliament for consideration for amendment to the Sexual Offences Act. These amendments will ensure that the register is extended to cover offenders who have committed any sexual offence, as it stands currently the register is limited to only individuals who are convicted and sentenced for violating a minor or an individual who is mentally disabled.1.5. Cabinet expresses its deepest condolences to the families and friends of Uyinene Mrwetyana, Leighandre Jegels, Nolunde Vumsindo, Meghan Cremer, Jess Hess, Ayakha Jiyane and her three siblings and all women and children who were brutally murdered by men. 1.6. Cabinet temporarily adjourned and released a delegation of Ministers from an ordinary sitting of Cabinet to meet with hundreds of protestors who had gathered at Parliament to protest against GBV.  1.7. Cabinet has also established an inter-ministerial committee that will work together with civil society to bring an end to GBV. This committee consists of Minister in The Presidency, Mr Jackson Mthembu; Minister of Police, Mr Bheki Cele; Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Dr Naledi Pandor; Minister of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation, Ms Lindiwe Sisulu; Minister of Defence and Military Veterans, Ms Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula; Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, Mr Ronald Lamola; Minister of State Security, Ms Ayanda Dlodlo, Minister of Social Development, Ms Lindiwe Zulu and Minister of in the Presidency for Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, Ms Maite Nkoana-Mashabane. This Committee will mobilize society as a whole against the phenomenon of GBV, and regularly update Cabinet and the public on its efforts to curb GBV.  The Committee will ensure that families and victims of GBV are supported. 1.8  Cabinet reflected on the progress made on the implementation of the Declaration of the Presidential Summit Against GBV and Femicide held in Centurion on 1 and 2 November 2018 to develop a national plan of action against GBV. An Interim Structure was established in January 2019 comprising of representatives of civil-society networks and government departments. A draft National Strategic Plan has been developed, which is based on consultative meetings, which build on the adopted Declaration. Consultations are underway across the country and will result in the envisaged National GBV and Femicide Council, which will be provided with the necessary resources to drive the anti GBV programme. 1.9  Notwithstanding that we have enacted many laws to deal with incidences of violence against women and children, and whilst we appreciate the efforts that police and other law-enforcement agencies   including our prosecutors, magistrates and judges   have made to arrest and sentence those responsible for these heinous crimes, Cabinet calls on all sectors of society, particularly men, to stand up against those who continue rape, abuse and kill women in our society. 1.10 Churches and religious leaders should take a firm stand and use their leadership and influence in communities to build positive social cohesion against GBV. The media should actively contribute towards addressing harmful social norms and beliefs that drive GBV while business leaders should address all forms of violence in the workplace and support our national efforts to eradicate GBV. Cabinet believes that it is only when society as a whole works together that we can end GBV and the killing of women.1.11 Cabinet has made a call to the South African society to ensure that the boy child is raised in a manner that respects the rights of all people, especially women in society. The boy child must be raised to know that women are their equals and not subordinates to be subjected to all sorts of abuse that end up in them being killed. 2. Public violence and unrest 2.1. Cabinet strongly condemns the recent sporadic violence that erupted in some parts of Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. South Africa is a constitutional democracy that is governed by laws and therefore, all peace-loving people should condemn such unlawful and unruly behaviour in the strongest possible terms. South Africa welcomes everyone who enters legally and abides by its laws. No grievance can justify violent attacks on other people, looting of shops, destruction of property and blocking of roads, which are all illegal and criminal offences punishable by law.2.2 Cabinet is encouraged by the speed with which the South African Police Service (SAPS) have acted in arresting 483 persons linked to looting, public violence and destruction of property in Gauteng and the 21 arrested in relation to the burning of trucks in KwaZulu-Natal. The loss of 10 lives, eight of whom are South Africans and two foreign nationals as a result of the unrest in Gauteng sadden cabinet. Cabinet expressed its deepest condolences to their families. 2.3 Cabinet also expressed its concern regarding the burning of trucks in KwaZulu-Natal arising from allegations that foreign nationals get preference for work as truck drivers as opposed to South Africans in the freight and logistics industry. Government is currently conducting road blocks with a particular focus on trucks, and if drivers are found to be undocumented foreign nationals, they are immediately sent back to their country of origin. 2. World Economic Forum (WEF) on Africa2.1. South Africa is hosting a number of state leaders as well as over a thousand regional and global leaders from politics, business, civil society and academia at the 28th WEF on Africa, in Cape Town from 4 to 6 September 2019.2.2. The theme of the summit, in which a number of stakeholders in the South African society and economy are also participating, is:  Shaping Inclusive Growth and Shared Futures in the Fourth Industrial Revolution . 2.3. The WEF on Africa is tackling the issues faced by the continent by focusing on how to scale up the transformation of regional architecture related to smart institutions, investment, integration, industry and innovation. The meeting is also addressing the African Union s Agenda 2063, the blueprint and master plan for transforming Africa into the global powerhouse of the future.2.4. South Africa s participation in the WEF on Africa, which brings top leaders together to create the conditions for socio-economic investment, will further enrich our programmes and interventions towards addressing our triple challenge of unemployment, inequality and poverty. This will take us closer to the realisation of Vision 2030 of the National Development Plan, our blueprint to eliminate poverty and reduce inequality by 2030. 2.5. Cabinet wishes all participants constructive and fruitful deliberations as they experience the warm Ubuntu hospitality of our country. 3. Employment Equity Amendment Bill3.1. Cabinet expressed concern at the slow pace of transformation in the workplace following the release of the 19th Commission for Employment Equity report. The report shows disappointingly low compliance levels with the Employment Equity Act, 1998 (Act 55 of 1998) which is aimed at addressing the apartheid legacy of imbalances and inequalities in our labour market. 3.2.  In an effort to strengthen the Employment Equity Act of 1998, government will be tabling the Employment Equity Amendment Bill in Parliament. 3.3.  The Bill increases fines for contravening the Act and makes it compulsory that employers who want to do business with the government provide an employment equity compliance certificate. 4. Nation-building4.1. Cabinet joins South Africans in welcoming the Equality Court s ruling on the restriction of the display of the pre-1994 apartheid era flag, which represents our divisive past. Cabinet supports the ruling that the old flag  impairs the dignity of black people and that those who display the apartheid flag consciously choose oppression over liberation .4.2. Symbols that represent the dark days of South Africa, especially the old flag, do not contribute towards building the united, non-racial and non-sexist society as envisioned in the progressive Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996. Cabinet calls on all South Africans to promote and strive for a common national identity as enshrined in our Constitution. 4.3. The display of the old apartheid flag should be restricted to genuine artistic, academic or journalistic expression that are in the public interest.B. Cabinet decisions1.  National Crime Statistics Report for 2018/191.1.  Cabinet approved the release the National Crime Statistics Report for 2018/19.1.2. The annual crime statistics enable government to monitor key targets, in particular the reduction of reported serious crimes, as set out in the Medium Term Strategic Framework. They could also serve to strengthen the crime-prevention operations and guide the strategies of various government departments. 1.3.  Minister of Police, General Bheki Cele will schedule a media briefing to release the findings of the crime statistics.2. Fishing Rights Allocation Process (FRAP) 2020 2.1.Cabinet gave permission for the Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries (DEFF) to revise time frames relating to the allocation process for licenses in 12 fisheries. Accordingly, Environment, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Barbara Creecy will shortly gazette the new time frames for the Fishing Rights Allocation Process (FRAP) 2020 process. 2.2.    Cabinet believes that it is essential the process is credible, transparent, and furthers transformation of the industry as a whole. New time frames will allow the DEFF to fulfil all regulatory requirements of the FRAP process, including appointing advisory and scientific bodies, undertaking research on fish stocks and implementing socio-economic studies on each fishery. C. Bills1. Judicial Matters Amendment Bill of 20191.1.  Cabinet approved for the submission of the Bill to Parliament.1.2. The Bill seeks to amend two Acts in order to address gaps identified by the Constitutional Court:      The Divorce Act, 1979 (Act 70 of 1979)   the amendment by the Bill further regulates the division of assets and maintenance of parties in divorce proceedings in accordance with a judgment of the Constitutional Court; and     The National Prosecuting Authority Act, 1998 (Act 32 of 1998)   the amendment by the Bill deals with aspects pertaining to the term of office of the National Director of Public Prosecutions and the Deputy National Directors of Public Prosecutions in accordance with a judgement of the Constitutional Court. D. Messages1. CondolencesCabinet sent condolences to the:1.1.  family and friends of Umkhonto We Sizwe Veteran and African National Congress Women s League member, pioneer businesswoman, Dr Thandi Cynthia Ndlovu, who passed away on 24 August 2019. The then Acting President David Mabuza declared a Special Provincial Official Funeral Category 2 for the late struggle stalwart and freedom fighter.

Violent attacks on foreign nationals and fellow South Africans3.1 Cabinet once again condemns the public violence and lawlessness that accompanies any real or imagined grievances of our people. We remain a constitutional democracy governed by the rule of law.3.2 Whilst cabinet understand the socio-economic challenges faced by communities, intolerance and violence towards foreign nationals and other South Africans will not resolve these challenges.3.3 We welcome anyone who enters the country legally and abide by the   laws of our country.  Equally, we remain a country united in our diversity and any form of animosity aimed at our fellow African brothers and sisters will not be tolerated.3.4 Cabinet is determined to decisively address the underlying causes that led to the attacks of foreign nationals and some South Africans. We also in the same vain will deal decisively with illegal activities such as drug peddling, illicit trading, looting of people s shops, as well as destruction of property and corruption without any fear or favour immaterial whether such criminality is perpetrated by a South African or a foreign national. The exploitation of the foreign nationals by some companies is also condemned.

They will interact with various groupings within our country with the view of   establishing the facts surrounding the violent attacks against foreign nationals and locals, which many have referred to as xenophobia and afrophobia. The findings of this commission will be shared with the African Union (AU) and importantly will assist us in dealing with the recurrence of violent attacks on both foreign nationals and our own citizens. 4. Attack of Councillor s houses4.1. Cabinet condemns in the strongest terms the burning down of the houses belonging to the City of Matlosana Councillors, in Khuma in the Province of the North West. There is no place of such behaviour in our young democracy.   Cabinet calls on the South African Police Service to do what it takes to arrest the perpetrators of this crime.  Let the law-abiding citizens of Khuma work with the law enforcement agencies to assist in apprehending the perpetrators.  They can assist with information through the anonymous toll free number 086010111.4.2. As South Africans let as take a stand in condemning lawlessness in our respective communities.  Our democracy has legislative system in place for anyone to elect or remove any public representative without resorting to violence. We therefore need to rise to protect our hard-earned democracy.4.3. Cabinet appeals to the public to take a stand against such criminality and to come forward with any information that will assist law enforcement authorities with their investigation.

Issues in the environment1. Coronavirus (COVID-19) 1.1. Cabinet reassures all in South Africa that every precaution is being taken to safeguard the country against any surge of the COVID-19. The Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize, reported to cabinet that there were 13 cases of COVID-19 in South Africa. This morning, the Minister of Health confirmed that another four new cases have been identified, bringing the number of COVID-19 cases to 17. He will provide further details during the course of the day. 1.2. Cabinet reiterates the call by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize, for all people in South Africa to continually practice preventative measures to stop the transmission and spread of the virus. The preventative measures include washing your hands often with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, they also include avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands and covering your mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing following with disposing of the tissue.Common symptoms of the virus include, fever, cough and difficulty in breathing.  When displaying the symptoms as described above, individuals are advised to stay home and seek medical assistance.1.3. We appeal to all to respect the privacy of CODVID-19 patients and their families. We also strongly caution against the dissemination of any false information related to the virus so as to prevent the spread of fear, stigma and discrimination within our society.  Concerned individuals may contact the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) Hotline on 0800 029 999 for accurate information regarding COVID-19.1.4. Cabinet joins President Cyril Ramaphosa in wishing well the repatriation team and the South African Airways crew who departed on Tuesday to the City of Wuhan, Hubei Province in the People s Republic of China, to repatriate 122 South Africans. The medical team from the Department of Health and the Military Health form part of the repatriation team. Cabinet has expressed its appreciation to South African Airways for their valuable assistance in this repatriation exercise.1.5. The repatriation team and the repatriated South Africans are expected back in the country this Friday, 13 March 2020. Upon their return, they will be quarantined for a minimum of 14 days, to a maximum of 21 days. During this period, the movement of people and goods in and out of the quarantine zone will be restricted.  1.6. We strongly caution people against attempting to make any physical contact or attempting to visit the quarantine zone.  Once the quarantine period ends, and tests confirm no underlying COVID-19 virus infection of our compatriots, they will be released back into their respective communities. 1.7. Cabinet commends the work done by the Inter-Ministerial Committee tasked to deal with COVID-19, led by the Minister of Health and working with the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), in tracking and containing the virus, while assisting those affected by it and continuously updating the nation. 1.8. Cabinet appreciates that most provinces have deferred communication on this COVID-19 matter to the Minister of Health because of its national and international importance. We urge all other provinces to also follow suit to ensure centralisation of communication and therefore avoid any unintended confusion and uncoordinated messaging. 1.9. President Ramaphosa will soon update political parties represented in Parliament as well as church leaders on COVID-19. A special Cabinet on COVID-19 is being convened for this Sunday, 15 March 2020, in Tshwane. 2.

Figures showed GDP decreasing by 1.4% in Quarter 4 of 2019. This follows a contraction of 0.8% in Quarter 3 of the same year.2.2. Despite acknowledging the debilitating effects of load shedding, Cabinet remains resolute in fixing the fundamentals, pursue critical areas of growth and drive collaborative solutions with all social partners so that together we set the country on a path to economic growth. 2.3. We are intensifying our investment and to date projects with an investment value of R9 billion have been completed and 27 projects worth just over R250 billion are in implementation phases, with more coming on stream this year.3. Vodacom Data Prices3.1 Cabinet welcomes the announcement by the Competition Commission on the landmark consent agreement reached with Vodacom regarding the reduction of the operator s data-prices. This follows the Competition Market Inquiry into data services requested by the then Minister of Economic Development Ebrahim Patel in 2017, which found that data-prices were higher than many other countries and discriminated against poorer consumers.  3.2 The agreement with Vodacom comes into effect on 1 April 2020 and will see cost of data decrease across all monthly bundles, with the 1GB bundle prices dropping from R149 to R99 (a reduction of 34%), with further discounts in the next year.

PepsiCo has committed to jobs, investment as well as local empowerment and procurement. It also agreed that its Sub-Saharan Headquarters would be located in South Africa.4.2 Pioneer Foods 10 000 workforce is also protected from merger-specific retrenchments and PepsiCo has agreed to maintain aggregate employment levels at current levels for a period of 5 years.  Employees in the company would also be issued with 1.6 billion Rands worth of shares in PepsiCo that will be used to acquire a 13% stake in Pioneer Foods within 5 years.5. Fight against women and child abuse5.1. Cabinet welcomes the Gauteng High Court ruling to turn down the request for leave to appeal in the case against convicted rapist Nicholas Ninow. Last year, Ninow was handed a life sentence after raping a seven-year-old girl at a Dros restaurant in Silverton, Pretoria in 2018.5.2. The judgement, sentencing and rejection of leave to appeal, sends a strong message to perpetrators and would-be perpetrators of women and children abuse that, South Africa s justice institutions will hold them accountable for their despicable actions.5.3.

Through our collective actions we must ensure that no woman or child is sexually harassed, beaten, raped or attacked anywhere in our country. 6. Road safety6.1.

Statement on the Virtual Cabinet Meeting of 27 May 2020,28 May 2020,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-virtual-cabinet-meeting-held-wednesday-27-may-2020-28-may-2020-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-virtual-cabinet-meeting-held-wednesday-27-may-2020-28-may-2020-0000,"1.  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in South Africa1.1.  Cabinet was briefed on the outcome of consultations undertaken by President Cyril Ramaphosa with various civil-society organisations, to ensure that the country s progression from Level 4 to Level 3 of the national lockdown has the support and inputs of all social partners.1.2. Accompanied by various Ministers, he met with community, labour and business sectors, South African Council of Churches; leadership of interfaith communities; Mayors; Premiers; South African Local Government Association, traditional leadership and political parties represented in Parliament.1.3.  Cabinet welcomed the outcome of these consultations, which were broadly constructive and enriched planning for the gradual easing of restrictions to Level 3 which kicks in on the 1st June 2020. This level will entail a further broadening of economic activity and the removal of restrictions on the movement of people. It will also enable about eight million South Africans to return to work.1.4. Special attention will be given to  hotspot  areas which have increased rates of coronavirus infections.

These consultations have made it possible for all sectors of society to play a role in the fight against the Covid19 pandemic, saving of lives and protecting livelihoods.1.6. The operational and technical management of COVID-19 interventions is driven by the National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure (NATJOINTS) and the Department of Health. NATJOINTS is a multidisciplinary coordinating structure of government that is activated to manage large projects. 1.7. The COVID-19 NATJOINTS is built on work streams that comprise scientists; health specialists; engineers; representatives of the National Disaster Management centres; legal advisors; leadership of the country s security and law-enforcement agencies, and teams from departments that make up the economic and social clusters of the Forum of South African Directors-General.1.8. NATJOINTS receives reports from different departments and submits proposals to Directors-General (DGs) to develop recommendations that are presented to the National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC).1.9. The NCCC deliberates DGs  recommendations and also makes its own recommendations to Cabinet where proposals, including regulations, are approved. This process ensures that the Executive takes collective decisions that are consensual and inclusive. Therefore, Cabinet condemns in the strongest possible terms false suggestions that individual members of the Executive are responsible for recommendations that emanate from the NCCC or decisions taken by Cabinet.1.10. Cabinet appeals for the unity in action by all sectors of society against a common and dangerous enemy, the COVID-19 pandemic.1.11. Cabinet thanks all South Africans for their continuing sacrifice and understanding during the purposeful lockdown period.

North High Court Judgment of Tuesday, 2 June 20201.1. A special virtual Cabinet meeting was held today, Thursday, 4 June 2020, to discuss developments in South Africa s efforts to save lives and protect livelihoods amid the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of this discussion, Cabinet reflected on the North Gauteng High Court judgment delivered by Justice Norman Davis on Tuesday, 2 June, 2020, which declared the COVID-19 lockdown regulations in levels 3 and 4 unconstitutional and invalid.1.2. After obtaining legal advice and listening to numerous comments made by members of the legal fraternity in reaction to the judgement, we are of the view that another court might come to a different conclusion on the matter.1.3. Cabinet has therefore decided to appeal the North Gauteng High court decision.1.4. Government will ask that its appeal be heard on an urgent basis so that it can obtain certainty on the regulations. The Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma will be joined in this appeal by President Cyril Ramaphosa and the Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize.1.5. Cabinet wishes to assure the nation that all interventions introduced since the declaration of a state of national disaster in March 2020 by President Cyril Ramaphosa have been directed primarily at saving lives.1.6. In implementing these interventions, government has consistently consulted all sectors of society, as the fight against COVID-19 is a national effort that requires unity in action between Government and all South Africans.1.7. While government appeals the court judgment, current regulations remain in force and we appeal and urge all our people to observe all the health protocols that have been put in place including washing of hands, social distancing, wearing of masks in public as well as screening and referral for testing where necessary.2. Extension of the National State of Disaster2.1  Cabinet approved the extension of the National State of Disaster by another month from the 15th June to 15 July 2020.

Water shortage5.1.    Cabinet has noted the recent drop in dam levels, particularly in the Western Cape.  As a water-scarce country, the dam levels have a negative impact on our water needs. Cabinet therefore makes an appeal to all of us to use water sparingly.Enquiries: Ms Phumla Williams   Cabinet SpokespersonCell: 083 501 0139 "

Cabinet reflected with disappointment on recent reports of acts of corruption and theft of the much-needed resources that government has allocated to save lives and livelihoods during the COVID-19 pandemic.1.2. Some unscrupulous individuals and companies have been looting state resources that were meant to provide food to needy families and personal protective equipment (PPEs) to frontline officials, particularly healthcare workers.   1.3. Such criminal and immoral activities included inflating quoted prices, intercepting and redirecting food parcels meant for the poor, and acts of fraud involving funds designated to alleviate the hardships of employees and businesses affected by the shutting down of economic activities during the national lockdown.   1.4. Cabinet has called on all public institutions to uphold the highest standards of integrity and accountability, and fulfil their mandates effectively and efficiently. Cabinet remains committed to building a capable, ethical and developmental state.

Cabinet also welcomes the amendments to the original regulations of the Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, Corruption and Fraud in the Public Sector, including Organs of State.

This will help to expedite the investigation and prosecution of corruption-related cases.1.10. As part of strengthening these interventions, Cabinet also approved the setting up of a team of five Ministers to, amongst others, look into all COVID-19-related procurements made during the lockdown period and strengthen current procurement systems.

These cases send a strong message that government will not tolerate any acts of corruption, particularly among its officials, and that all perpetrators will be arrested and prosecuted. 1.13.    Corruption is the biggest crime that robs the poor and deprives them of basic services. As a society, we are responsible for the fight against corruption and should expose it without fear or favour.

Alert Level 2 will make it possible for Ministers to present themselves before the two houses of Parliament, the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces, to amongst others, answer questions from members of Parliament.1.3. While the  second wave  of infections experienced by several other countries is an ever-present possibility, our collective actions over the next few weeks and months can prevent that from happening, and will determine how quickly we move further forward. Cabinet calls on everyone to take extra precautions, practise responsible behaviour and do the right things so that we avoid a second peak.  1.4. Government is working with social partners and communities to ensure that districts are adequately resourced and organised to contain the spread of the virus.     1.5. Our nation has made great strides in fighting the pandemic. Our good work, unfortunately, is being undermined by the reckless actions of some people who refuse to take personal responsibility to prevent the spread of the virus. Those who drive under the influence of alcohol and behave recklessly are endangering the lives of innocent people. 1.6. As a result of such reckless behaviour, this week we mourn the untimely death of three Tshwane Metro Police Department officers who lost their lives in a tragic crash with a drunk driver this past weekend. This fatal accident is a wake-up call to all of us, individually and collectively, to reflect on what we can do to begin acting responsibly and playing our part in curbing alcohol abuse.1.7. Cabinet urges all people in South Africa to continue observing the health protocols even during Alert Level 2. We must all maintain social distancing, wear a mask when in public and regularly wash hands with water and soap or use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser. 2. Return to school and tertiary institutions 2.1. Cabinet welcomed the reopening of primary and secondary schools under the Department of Basic Education this past Monday. Grades 6 and 11 learners returned to classes on Monday while Grades 7 and 12 learners returned last month following the temporary closure of schools to prevent the potential spread of COVID-19. 2.2. Cabinet also welcomed the announcement that under Alert Level 2 lockdown, all universities will be allowing the controlled return of students to campus-based tuition in line with the criteria published in the Government Gazette (Vol 660, No 43414 on 8 June 2020). According to the criteria developed, under Level 2 of the lockdown, a maximum of 66% of students will be allowed to return to university campuses. 2.3. It also welcomed the staggered return of Technical and Vocational Education and Training college students, the reopening of Community Education and Training centres and the return of staff to their workplace. This will be done in terms of the detailed COVID-19 management plans in place across the sector, and to ensure the continued safety of students and staff, while allowing for greater access to campus teaching and learning for more students. 3. Anti-corruption3.1. Cabinet reiterated its commitment to ensure that allegations of corruption relating to COVID-19 procurement are swiftly investigated by law-enforcement agencies such as the Special Investigating Unit. Those implicated will be severely punished, and money stolen from the State by unscrupulous companies and individuals by inflating the prices of personal protective equipment will be recovered. 3.2. Cabinet is also pleased with the progress made by the Committee of Ministers chaired by Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola. The team of Ministers was expected to coordinate the compilation of all the COVID-19 procurements and make it accessible to the public. In the interest of transparency, National Treasury s website (www.treasury.gov.za) has since published the information of most of the departments and entities that have fully complied.  3.3. National Treasury will continue with additional work to refine the submitted information for further processing. Cabinet reaffirms that law-enforcement agencies will continue to be responsible for the investigative work. 3.4. The  Fusion Centre, which coordinates the work of all law-enforcement agencies, remains  on track to present its first six weekly report in the first week of September 2020 to President Cyril Ramaphosa.3.5. Cabinet will give the necessary support to all law-enforcement agencies.This will include giving them the resources they need to function optimally, independently without fear, favour and prejudice in facilitating  the investigation and prosecution of corruption-related cases without any further delay.  3.6. The scourge of corruption, which manifests itself in the blatant theft and looting of state resources, is the biggest societal cancer that has the potential to erode public trust in government s concerted efforts to improve the lives of the people. Cabinet condemns in the strongest possible terms all acts of corruption and is confident that all wrongdoers will eventually be prosecuted, without fear or favour.3.7. Cabinet calls on all South Africans to report corruption to the National Anti-Corruption Hotline on 0800 701 701.B. Cabinet Decisions1. Training programmes for members of the Executive and senior managers in the Public Service1.1. Cabinet approved two training programmes that will give effect to the commitment of building the capacity of the state. The first one is the Economic Governance Spring School training, for members of the Executive from all spheres of government.  It is designed to broaden learning perspectives through analysis and critical reflection on the nature of challenges of government. It will be conducted by the National School of Government (NSG), in partnership with the Wits School of Governance and the OR Tambo School of Leadership.1.2. The second programme is designed for heads of departments. It consists of three components, namely an Executive Induction Programme, Executive Education Programme and a new programme to be called Etella. These programmes will be conducted by the NSG, in partnership with the University College London.  2. Postponement of the hosting of  the 2020 International Maritime Organisation (IMO)2.1. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cabinet has approved the postponement of hosting the IMO and its parallel event of World Maritime Day, from October 2020 to October 2021. Cabinet had approved the hosting of this event in November 2015. C. Bills1. Agricultural Produce Agents Amendment Bill of 20181.1. Cabinet approved the submission of the Agricultural Produce Agents Amendment Bill of 2018 to Parliament. The amendments seek to protect the rights of the producers from unregulated aspects of the fresh produce agents. Once passed into law, the agents will amongst others be compelled to take out fidelity insurance and keep trust accounts. 1.2. The amendments proposed in the Bill were fully canvased with all relevant stakeholders. The changes will also improve market access opportunities for smallholder producers as well as previously disadvantaged market agents, traders and hawkers. 2. Sectional Titles Amendment Bill2.1. Cabinet approved the submission of the Bill to Parliament. The Bill amends the Sectional Titles Act, 1986 (Act 95 of 1986), which provides for the establishment of sectional title schemes. The proposed amendments provide clarity and protect the lessees in the properties under the sectional-arrangement buildings. 3. Electoral Law Amendment Bill of 20203.1. Cabinet approved the submission of the Electoral Law Amendment Bill of 2020 to Parliament. The Bill amends three pieces of legislation, namely the Electoral Commission Act, 1996 (Act 51 of 1996);  Electoral Act, 1998 (Act 73 of 1998) and Local Government Municipal Electoral Act, 2000 (Act 27 of 2000).3.2. The proposed changes will enhance the existing legislative mechanism. The amendments will amongst others introduce innovations in electoral practices in keeping with best practices to improve the Independent Electoral Commission s efficiency in managing elections. D.

Statement on the virtual Cabinet Meeting of 9 September 2020,9 Sep 2020,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-virtual-cabinet-meeting-9-september-2020-10-sep-2020-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-virtual-cabinet-meeting-9-september-2020-10-sep-2020-0000,"A.     Issues in the environment1.        Update on the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) 1.1.    Cabinet welcomes the drop in the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases over the past few weeks and the improved recovery rate that has increased to 87 percent. The number of people requiring admission in our hospitals and the demand for COVID-19 tests have also dropped. 1.2.    Cabinet thanks all South Africans for playing their part in adhering to restrictions to flatten the curve. We commend the dedication and sacrifice of all health professionals who have been our frontline defence against the virus.      1.3.    Let us build on the momentum of this encouraging news and continue to work together to consistently do the right things, such as practising social distancing, wearing a mask when in public, and washing hands with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser. 1.4.    Cabinet encourages all people in South Africa to download the free COVID Alert SA Application from the Apple App Store or Google Play. The Department of Health introduced the app as another tool to alert South Africans if they have been exposed to someone with COVID-19. The app strengthens our nation s fight against the spread of the virus.  1.5.    Cabinet also approved the extension of the national state of disaster to 15 October 2020 in terms of Section 27(5)(c) of the Disaster Management Act, 2002 (57 of 2002). This is to continue giving effect to the regulations that remain relevant to manage the spread of COVID-19 infections.  2.       Gender-based violence (GBV)2.1.    The scourge of GBV continues to plague our nation with the senseless violent assault and murder of women. The recent victims of this heinous crime include actress Thandeka Mdeliswa (34) who was shot at her family home in Evander, Mpumalanga and the 28-year-old woman who was killed by her husband while reporting a domestic violence at the Madeira Police Station in the Eastern Cape. Cabinet calls for justice to be served on these crimes and others that are reported.2.2.    Cabinet recently approved three laws to intensify the fight against GBV. They are the Domestic Violence Amendment Bill; Criminal and Related Matters Amendment Bill of 2020; and the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Bill of 2020. These laws contribute towards ensuring effective and efficient protection for victims of domestic violence and GBV.          3.       Clicks advertisement        3.1.    Cabinet has noted with great concern an extremely disturbing advertisement published on the Clicks website, which justifiably triggered widespread public outrage. Cabinet considers the advertisement profoundly offensive and racist.3.2.    Black hair has been the subject of intense politicisation and a source of unjust discrimination in our recent history. Our nation s history is littered with laws and societal norms that equated  blackness  and the associated physical traits   for example, dark skin, kinky and curly hair   to a badge of inferiority. 3.3.    We therefore welcome the immediate corrective actions taken by Clicks.  These include their commitment to work with government to promote local products in all their stores and to collaborate with all their suppliers to promote the constitutional values as enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996. They will also put in place a diversity and inclusion training programme for all their managers and staff. 3.4.    Cabinet calls on the advertising agencies of Clicks and other stores to also adopt tangible programmes which promote and protect human rights, and raise awareness about despicable issues of racism, inequality and discrimination. 3.5.    All sectors of our society must endorse partnerships between government departments and Chapter Nine institutions in implementing anti-racism and anti-discrimination educational campaigns.3.6.    Equally, government reminds all South Africans that the right to speak out against any injustice without fear of reprisal is enshrined in our Constitution. However, the right to protest comes with the inherent responsibility to do so peacefully and without infringing on the rights of others. Government condemns the acts of vandalism at Clicks stores. Such unlawful acts undermine the spirit of human rights that has shaped this country since the dawn of democracy. 3.7.    South Africa is working towards growing the economy and cannot afford to risk the loss of jobs due to business closures. Lawlessness and vandalism of private and public property should not be condoned as they are not a responsible and progressive option to resolve a conflict. 4.        Economy4.1.    The steep contraction of our Quarter 2 Gross Domestic Product to record levels of 16,4% annualized to 51,2% as a result of COVID-19, raises the risk of reaching the Supplementary Budget forecast of -7.2% growth in 2020.   4.2.    This affirms the correctness of government s decision to urgently embark on an economic recovery plan, working together with all our social partners to get the economy on a better growth trajectory.4.3.    The plan, which will be infrastructure led, will also include implementation of much-needed structural reforms. 5.    Death of Nathaniel Julius5.1.    Cabinet expressed its condolences to the family of Nathaniel Julius, a 16-year-old boy who was allegedly shot and killed by police officers in Eldorado Park. 5.2.    The arrest of the three police officers by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) on charges of murder and defeating the ends of justice affirms the fundamental principle that no person is above the law. 5.3.    Cabinet calls on the community of Eldorado Park to assist the IPID and continue to work within the criminal justice system to ensure that justice prevails. 6.     Auditor-General Report (AG) on COVID-19 procurements6.1.    The recent AG Report also highlighted some irregularities and illegal transactions on the COVID-19 relief package introduced by government to ease economic distress and prevent the spread of the virus. 6.2.    The findings will be handed over to the multi-agency Fusion Centre that is tasked with investigating COVID-19-related fraud and corruption. Findings include overpricing, government employees applying for relief they were not entitled to, potential fraud and the sidestepping of supply chain management rules and regulations.6.3.    Cabinet reiterates its resolve to continue to decisively pursue all those found to have abused these funds irrespective of who they are. The discrepancies that are exposed by the public through the information published on the National Treasury website (www.treasury.gov.za) will be followed up with the relevant departments. B.    Cabinet decisions 1.    National Climate Change interventions1.1.    Cabinet approved the establishment of the Presidential Climate Change Coordinating Commission. This is in line with the Presidential Job Summit Framework Agreement signed during the Presidential Job Summit in 2018. The commission will coordinate the just transition of our country to a low carbon climate and resilient economy and society by 2050.1.2.    The structure will be represented by government, social partners, civil society as well as experts from academia and research institutions.  South Africa is the signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).  1.3.    Cabinet also approved the submission of the country s Low Emission Development (LED) Strategy to the UNFCCC Secretariat. This LED Strategy will advance the national climate change and development policy in a more coordinated, coherent and strategic manner. It provides mitigation measures focusing on four key sectors of the economy, namely Energy; Industry; Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use; and Waste. 2.    National Waste Management Strategy (NWMS) 20202.1.    Cabinet approved the 2020 NWMS to replace the 2011 NWMS. The waste management strategy gives into effect the terms of the National Environmental Management: Waste Act, 2008 (Act 59 of 2008). It directs the environmental protection programmes. It drives a sustainable and an environmentally friendly, inclusive economic growth, with three focus pillars   waste minimisation, effective and sustainable services, and waste awareness and compliance. 3.    Agricultural colleges 3.1.    Cabinet approved the establishment of agricultural colleges as the competency of Higher Education Colleges in terms of the Higher Education Act, 1997 (101 of 1997), as amended.   3.2.    The agricultural colleges   which are currently under the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development   provide programmes that are aligned to higher education qualifications which include skills training and vocational programmes. The relocation of these colleges to the Department of Higher Education and Training will align them to the prescribed Higher Education Act of 1997 and will improve their governance and management. 4.    2017/18 Report on Research and Development (R&D) Tax Incentive Programme 4.1.    Cabinet approved the submission of the 2017/18 Report to Parliament on R&D Tax Incentive Programme. The research tracks usage of the incentive by companies to promote research and development within their respective sectors. This tax incentive programme was first introduced in November 2006. According to the report, from November 2006 to February 2018, out of 1 091 companies which applied for support, 902 were granted this tax incentive. The full report will be accessible once presented in Parliament.  5.    Draft White Paper on Audio and Visual Content Services Policy Framework5.1.    Cabinet approved publication of the Draft White Paper on Audio and Audio Visual Content Services Policy Framework: A New Vision for South Africa 2020, for public consultation and comment. 5.2.    The White Paper, amongst others, proposes new policy and regulatory changes and recommendations intended to reposition the audio-visual media sectors for future growth and promote investments. 6.    Transformation of the Heritage Landscape6.1.    Cabinet was briefed on the progress made by the consultative task team led by the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture on the transformation of the heritage landscape. The team was to reflect on the current heritage landscape, and how Cabinet responds to the historical and critical values of our Constitution. 6.2.    The team makes recommendations of the statues/monuments that should espouse the founding values of the new democratic South Africa. It proposes the relocation of some of the historical statues to the theme parks that will be located across the country. A full audit of all the statues, symbols and monuments will be done and the outcome thereof will guide the identification of the proposed cultural nation-building parks. 6.3     Cabinet endorses this process, which will contribute towards nation-building and ensure public spaces reflect the constitutional values of a post-colonial and post-apartheid democratic order. The cultural nation building parks will relocate all the historical details that depict colonialism and apartheid artefacts for future generations. C.    Messages1.

Statement on virtual Cabinet Meeting of 23 September 2020,24 Sep 2020,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-virtual-cabinet-meeting-23-september-2020-24-sep-2020-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-virtual-cabinet-meeting-23-september-2020-24-sep-2020-0000,"Statement on the Virtual Cabinet Meeting of Wednesday, 23 September 2020A. ISSUES IN THE ENVIRONMENT1. Update on the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) In his address to the nation on Wednesday, 16 September 2020, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the move to Alert Level 1 of the national lockdown with effect from Monday, 21 September 2020. This has further opened up more economic activities in the country, which will contribute immensely to rebuilding the economy, restoring growth and creating much-needed jobs.The announcements made by the President were favourably welcomed by all sectors of the South African society   including labour, business, civil society and political formations.The national state of disaster regulations which give effect to the announcements by the President, were gazetted on Friday, 18 September 2020. The new regulations eased certain restrictions implemented since March 2020 to prevent the spread of the virus. They include, amongst others, the permissible number of people at public gatherings, events and funerals, as well as the opening of borders for travel within Africa and internationally, effective from 1 October 2020.Cabinet has encouraged further engagement with the traditional leadership to address issues related to initiation schools and practices, which are still prohibited during Alert Level 1. More information on the gazetted regulations is accessible on the government website (www.gov.za).Cabinet urges all people in South Africa to continue observing the COVID-19 health protocols such as maintaining social distancing, wearing a mask in public and regularly washing hands with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser.Cabinet also encourages the public to download the COVID Alert mobile app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. The app   which has been zero-rated by mobile networks and can be downloaded without any data costs   will improve contact tracing by alerting users if they have been in close contact with other users who have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past14 days.  The App does not gather any personal information or track a user s location.Gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF)Cabinet remains determined to fight the scourge of GBVF by strengthening the security cluster structures; legislative framework; providing psychosocial support and advocacy programmes within communities.  Based on data obtained through the South African Police Service (SAPS), government has sadly identified 30 GBVF hotspots around the country. Cabinet has assured the affected communities that working with the police, intervention measures will be strengthened to ensure the protection and safety of women and children.Cabinet has welcomed and appreciated the R50-million donation from the United Kingdom which will extend the Solidarity Fund s ongoing efforts to counter the economic devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The funds will focus on projects that support and promote women.Cabinet also expressed concern at disturbing reports of human-trafficking incidences involving women and children in the country. Police are following up and investigating all reported cases related to human and drug trafficking.Cabinet appeals to the public to report these heinous crimes to the police immediately instead of using social media platforms, which makes it difficult for law-enforcement agencies to respond quickly and adequately. The public is again cautioned to refrain from peddling fake news, which may cause unnecessary panic, inflame emotions and incite violence in our society.Anyone with information should contact the SAPS on the Crime Stop number 08600 10111 or use the free MySAPS Application, which can be downloaded on any iPhone or smartphone.3. Destruction and theft of public infrastructureCabinet welcomes the recent arrests of suspects in Johannesburg and Cape Town involved in stealing copper cables and train signal cables. Police also acted swiftly in arresting people involved in the destruction of the main road in Msinga, KwaZulu-Natal. Cabinet commends this breakthrough made by the police on the theft and vandalizing of the rail infrastructure; a serious crime which resulted in some instances in the loss of innocent lives due to train collusions. Public infrastructure remains the cornerstone of driving our economy. It remains a critical component in our drive to grow the economy and create the much-needed jobs. Cabinet calls on all South Africans to report these criminal activities to the police.4.South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) online serviceCabinet welcomed the launch of the online grant application portal by the SASSA, which enables applications to be lodged on https://services.sassa.gov.za. The portal   which will initially be piloted on Child Support, Older Persons and Foster Child grants   will save potential beneficiaries transport costs and the inconvenience of standing in queues.Cabinet encourages new applicants to use the self-service as it helps to eliminate the potential risk of contracting COVID-19 at overcrowded public places.5. United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)President Ramaphosa participated in the virtual UNGA Debate of the 75th Session of the UNGA on Tuesday, 22 September 2020 under the theme:  The Future We Want, the UN We Need: Reaffirming our Collective Commitment to Multilateralism .Cabinet advocates that the anniversary be used as an opportunity to achieve much-needed reforms of the UN Security Council (UNSC) to reflect contemporary realities in the world.South Africa will preside over the UNSC for a second time in December 2020 as it completes its third term as an elected member of the UNSC.6.

Southern African Customs Union (SACU) Council of Ministers MeetingCabinet welcomed the outcomes of the SACU Council of Ministers Meeting held on Monday, 21 September 2020. Finance and Trade Ministers from Namibia, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho and South Africa attended the meeting, which was chaired by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni and South Africa was represented by Minister Patel.The council considered the role of SACU in the context of the new African Continental Free Trade Agreement. It resolved that the future work of the council will focus on building and developing SACU countries into a stronger manufacturing and innovation hub that can provide goods and services across the continent.B. CABINET DECISIONS1. Presidential Commission on the Fourth Industrial Revolution (PC4IR) ReportCabinet approved the publication of the PC4IR Report in the Government Gazette. The report makes proposals to reinvigorate the country s industrialisation aspirations and improve our global and continental economic competiveness to enhance inclusive growth.Key drivers of the PC4IR Strategy include economic competiveness, responding to service delivery challenges, human capacity investment and responding to COVID-19.This gives effect to the 2018 State of the Nation Address, which directed that a Digital Industrial Revolution Commission would respond to rapid technological advances and ensure the nation s prosperity.2. Transport Month 2020 CampaignCabinet approved the 2020 October Transport Month campaign programme under the theme:  Together Shaping the Future of Transport .

SAPS Amendment Bill of 2020Cabinet approved publication of the Bill in the Government Gazette for public comments. The Bill amends the SAPS Act, 1995 (Act 68 of 1995), to bring it in line with the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996 and to ensure optimal policing.  It provides, amongst others, a legal framework in the governance of the police service and the establishment of community-based neighbourhood forums. The Bill also takes into consideration the recommendations that came out of the Marikana Commission of Inquiry led by retired Judge Ian Farlam.D. UPCOMING EVENT1.

" Statement on the virtual Cabinet Meeting of 21 October 2020",22 Oct 2020,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-virtual-cabinet-meeting-wednesday-21-october-2020-22-oct-2020-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-virtual-cabinet-meeting-wednesday-21-october-2020-22-oct-2020-0000,"A.    Issues in the environment1.    Economy1.1.    The Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan that President Cyril Ramaphosa presented to a Joint Hybrid Sitting of Parliament on Thursday, 15 October 2020, requires all sectors to roll up their sleeves and work together to stabilise our economy. 1.2.    The plan builds on the common ground established by the social partners   government, labour, business and community organisations   through intensive and detailed consultations over the last few months.1.3.    There are four priority areas that underpin this economic recovery plan, the first being a massive roll-out of infrastructure. The second priority area is to expand energy generation capacity with government accelerating the implementation of the Integrated Resource Plan. The third key area is that of an employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods. The fourth area focuses on industrial growth where government will support growth in local production and make South African exports more competitive.1.4.    The identified priority areas will contribute towards building confidence and placing South Africa on a new path for investment and economic growth following the devastation caused by the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. 1.5.    To ensure the regular monitoring of the implementation of the plan, Cabinet approved the setting up of the National Economic Recovery Council. The council will be chaired by the President and comprises the Deputy President, Minister in The Presidency and all the Ministers in the Economic Cluster. The council will meet monthly to oversee implementation of the economic reconstruction and recovery plan and also to interface with the social partners in the National Economic Development and Labour Council. 2.    National State of Disaster 2.1.    The extension of the National State of Disaster to 15 November 2020, in terms of the Disaster Management Act, 2002 (Act 57 of 2002), will enable government to further minimise the spread of the virus.2.2.    Whilst South Africa has experienced a massive decrease in the transmission and spread of COVID-19 over the past months, the virus remains with us. 2.3.    As the country adapts to the  new normal  of coexisting with COVID-19 and a possible resurgence, Cabinet once again urges all South Africans to continue adhering to the health protocols of wearing masks, practising social distancing and frequently washing hands with water and soap or using an alcohol-based sanitiser. These are the only preventive measures available to protect ourselves, our families and loved ones from contracting COVID-19.  2.4.    Cabinet wishes all those infected by the virus including our Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize and his wife, Dr May Mkhize, a speedy recovery. 2.5.    Cabinet once again wishes to thank all the frontline health workers for their commitment and dedication which led to the increase in the country s COVID-19 recovery rate to over 90% and keeping our fatality rate at 2.6% 3.    Focus on rural safety 3.1.    Cabinet fully supports the work of our South African police in arresting those committing heinous crime in our country which includes the killing and maiming of farmers and farm workers throughout the country. The farming community is an integral part of our economy, and crime on farms poses a threat not only to the personal safety of farmers and farmworkers but also to the country s food security. 3.2.    Government is fast-tracking the implementation of the revised Rural Safety Strategy to respond to the security needs of rural communities and support socio-economic development. 3.3.    Cabinet calls on the nation to assist the South African Police Service (SAPS) in the fight against crime by joining community police forums and to report crime to the nearest police station, call the toll-free Crime Stop number at 08600 10111, send an anonymous SMS to Crime Line at 32211 or use the MySAPS App   the free, crime-reporting mobile application available for smartphones   to provide anonymous crime tip-offs.3.4.    We must work together to root out crime in our communities and make our country safer for all. 4.    Anti-corruption4.1.    Cabinet welcomes the arrest of persons allegedly involved in various cases of corruption, fraud, money laundering and theft. These cases include, among others, those related to the looting of COVID-19 social relief funds, the fraudulent procurement of Covid 19 personal protective equipment, the scandal related to the asbestos housing project and failure to report or under reporting to the South African Revenue Service . Cabinet fully appreciates and supports all endeavours to recover public funds from all those who have engaged in these fraudulent activities  4.2.    The recent arrests are a testament that no one is above the law and they demonstrate government s commitment to hold to account those who continue to break the law by robbing poor South Africans of much needed government assistance and Aid 4.3.    Cabinet calls on the public to play their part by reporting those who commit such crimes to law-enforcement agencies or calling the National Anti-Corruption Hotline on 0800 701 701. 5.    Gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF)5.1.    The scourge of GBVF and the abuse of children, which President Ramaphosa has denounced as the second pandemic after COVID-19, remains a plague on our communities and we must do our best to eradicate it. The Bill of Rights enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996 specifically states that every child has the right to be protected from maltreatment, neglect, abuse or degradation.5.2.    Cabinet calls on all South Africans to work together with our law-enforcement agencies in ensuring that all vulnerable groups   particularly the elderly, women and children   are protected from violence and abuse5.3.    The recent case of two eight-year-old girls (twins) from Mpumalanga who were allegedly abused by their father, is deeply disturbing and concerning.  One of the girls reported the incidence to her school teacher and we must commend the response by the school that led to the arrest of the suspect. As a law-abiding and peace-loving nation, we should all unite in condemning such heinous crimes with the utmost contempt they deserve. 6.    Media freedom6.1.    The 43rd anniversary of media freedom, known as Black Wednesday in South Africa, was commemorated on Monday, 19 October 2020. This day reminds us of the significance of the freedom of expression in our bill of rights, which includes, media freedom as an important tenant, in our constitutional democracy.  6.2    Media Freedom Day marks the banning of a number of newspapers and arrests of their respective editors on 19 October 1977 by the apartheid police, for exposing the atrocities committed by the oppressive regime. Media continue to play an important role in entertaining, educating and informing society, as well as interpreting all facets of our socio-economic and political lives.6.2.    Media remains a vital partner in strengthening our democracy and promoting the constitutional rights of our citizens. The freedom to perform their duties comes with the responsibility to ensure that they report fairly and objectively at all times.6.3.    Cabinet pays tribute to all journalists who lost their lives during these difficult times of COVID-19, and commits to respect and uphold freedom of expression, inclusive of media freedom in our country.7.    End-of-year examinations 7.1.    Cabinet wishes the 1.058 699 million (one million and fifty eight thousand six hundred and ninety nine) Grade 12 learners good luck as they begin preparing for the final examinations due to start on 5 November 2020 and end on 15 December 2020.  This year the Department of Basic Education has recorded the highest number of Grade 12 learners that will write their final exams.7.2.    Following interruptions to the academic year due to COVID-19, Cabinet appeals to all parents and guardians to support their children during this important time. The matric class of 2020 is urged to use the resources made available by government through the Woza Matrics 2020 Catch-Up campaign (wozamatrics.co.za and #wozamatrics) in preparing for the National Senior Certificate examinations. B.    Cabinet decisions 1.    Support to the domestic ferrochrome industry 1.1.    Cabinet approved a number of interventions to support domestic ferrochrome production and its chrome value-chain sector. The interventions include the proposed introduction of the export tax on chrome ore, the usage of energy efficiency technologies on smelters, and the adoption of cogeneration and self-generation technologies.1.2.    The local ferrochrome sector is the largest global producer of ferrochrome and is the only stainless-steel producer. It is the biggest supplier of stainless steel to the automotive industry. The proposed interventions were put together by a task team comprising the departments of Mineral Resources and Energy, Trade, Industry and Competition, Public Enterprises and National Treasury. 2.    National Youth Policy (NYP): 2020-20302.1.    Cabinet approved the third revised NYP 2020-2030, which is a cross-sectoral policy that was developed by representative government departments, civil-society partners, institutions of higher learning and business bodies. It replaces the NYP 2015-2020, which expires at the end of December 2020. 2.2.    The policy proposes five key priorities: (1) quality education, skills and second chances; (2) economic transformation, entrepreneurship and job creation; (3) physical and mental health promotion, including COVID-19; (4) social cohesion and nation-building, and (5) effective and responsive youth development machinery. 3.

The five-year plan outlines the strategic priorities and the implementation mechanisms in protecting and harnessing the rights of children. The plan is aligned to the Medium Term Strategic Framework that sets out the actions government will take and targets to be achieved during an electoral term. It will be implemented in collaboration with civil-society organisations. 3.3.    The NPAC will also serve as a framework to provide the country s progress reports to both the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. 4.

The 2020 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement presented by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni on Wednesday, 28 October 2020, sets out a course that limits the operational spending of government.

Cabinet calls on all people in South Africa to continue adhering to the health protocols of practising social distancing, wearing masks in public and washing our hands with water and soap or an alcohol-based sanitiser, and avoiding large gatherings.2.2. Such consistent considerate behaviour remains the greatest defence in protecting ourselves and others against the virus.

The Bill broadens access to justice for  small enterprises through the Ombud Service, which will be tasked with considering and disposing of complaints by small enterprises.1.3.

National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) Amendment Bill 2.1.    Cabinet approved the submission of the NYDA Amendment Bill for public comment. The amendments enhance the operational effectiveness of the NYDA in expanding its reach and increasing responsiveness to young people s needs.2.2.    Youth constitute nearly a third of South Africa s population and implementation of this Bill will go further in contributing towards building a highly skilled labour force and also increasing support for  entrepreneurship.  This will contribute towards addressing the triple developmental challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment.D.  Upcoming events   1.  16 Days of Activism 1.1.    Cabinet approved the theme:  Women s Economic Justice towards a non-violent and non-sexist South Africa  for the 16 Days of Activism campaign, which is the high-point of the 365 Days against GBVF campaign.

It is the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to fully approve Pre- exposure Prophylaxis, which is now being made available to those at high risk of infection.2.3.    Cabinet urges South Africans to follow the Cheka Impilo three steps: First, get your health checked, get tested for HIV and TB for free at any clinic near you.

Statement on virtual Cabinet Meeting of 2 December 2020,4 Dec 2020,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-virtual-cabinet-meeting-wednesday-2-december-2020-4-dec-2020-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-virtual-cabinet-meeting-wednesday-2-december-2020-4-dec-2020-0000,"A. Issues In The Environment1. Increase in Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) infections1.1. Cabinet has expressed extreme concern about the spike in the number of new COVID-19 infections in the Eastern Cape and parts of the Western Cape. The rise in infections has been attributed to, among other factors, non-adherence to COVID-19 prevention protocols and Alert Level 1 regulations.1.2. Cabinet approved the proposed intervention measures for the Nelson Mandela Bay (NMB) Metropolitan Municipality to address increasing COVID-19 infections. Cabinet also approved that the initiation schools may proceed within the strict health protocols outside of the NMB Metro. The Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize, will be undertaking visits to the Western Cape to assess what needs to be done to intervene in areas such as the Garden Route. 1.3. Cabinet reiterated the importance of adhering to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as washing hands with water and soap or using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser, maintaining social distancing and wearing a mask in public. All of us should support the call by the World Health Organisation to prevent new COVID-19 infections.1.4. As we approach the festive season, we should remember that the pandemic is still active and dangerous. Therefore, we must avoid unnecessary travel, particularly by public transport, and limit frequenting public venues such as restaurants, taverns or bars. Each of us needs to ensure we take precautions to avoid spreading the virus to our families, especially our elders. 1.5. We must always maintain social distancing even as we gather as families to celebrate the holidays. Through our responsible behaviour, we can all contribute to fighting and containing the spread of COVID-19. Cabinet also approved the extension of the National State of Disaster to 15 January 2021.2. Freight transport industry2.1. Cabinet strongly condemned the lawlessness affecting the road freight industry and commended the swift response by the police in arresting suspects in Gauteng. Cabinet offered its condolences to the families and colleagues of drivers who lost their lives and wish those injured a speedy recovery.2.2. While we understand the frustrations at the violation of immigration laws by some companies, violence is not the solution. Cabinet calls on all affected people to submit their concerns about the freight transport industry to relevant structures instead of resorting to violence.2.3. Employment and Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi is leading a team of Ministers that is dealing with this matter and is expected to submit a concrete proposal to Cabinet to address all disputes affecting the industry. 3. Infrastructure development3.1. Cabinet welcomed the handover of the uMshwathi Bulk Water Supply Scheme in KwaZulu-Natal, which will completely change the lives of more than 3 000 households in the areas of Albert Falls, Mpolweni, Trustfeed and Nadi.3.2. The scheme is a precursor to various other regional bulk water supply projects that will span across seven district municipalities   Zululand, King Cetshwayo, iLembe, uThukela, uMgungundlovu and Harry Gwala. Cabinet urges the beneficiaries to conserve and use water sparingly for the benefit of all households. 4. Safer holidays4.1. As South Africans take time to enjoy the holidays with their families and friends, Cabinet encourages all of us to do so responsibly. In addition to adhering to all health protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19, we must also abide by the rules of the road to ensure that we all reach our destinations safely. 4.2. Road safety is the responsibility of all South Africans and all motorists are urged to adhere to the speed limit, do not drink and drive, and do not drive recklessly and negligently. 4.3. Parents and caregivers are urged not to leave children unsupervised during the holiday season. By working together to take care, we can ensure a safe and joyous festive season.B. Cabinet Decisions1. P Cabinet approved the IMTT recommendation for a withdrawal of the direct interventions under section 100(1)(b) in North West by the end of the 2020/21 financial year.1.2. Cabinet is satisfied with progress that has been made on the national government s intervention in North West, although more work still needs to be done to fully restore good governance in the province. 1.3. Progress has been made in restoring community and labour peace, financial controls, consequence management and service delivery. There has also been a turnaround in audit results, and an end to six years of decline and stagnation of audit findings.  A full report will be tabled in Parliament.2. Update on the South African Airways (SAA) Business Rescue Plan (BR Plan)2.1. Cabinet was briefed on the progress regarding the implementation of the SAA BR Plan and how the allocation of the R10.5 billion will be effectively used to ensure the success in the implementation of the BR Plan.  2.2. Cabinet appreciated the progress and implored the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) to hasten the implementation of key initiatives to ensure the emergence of a new restructured, efficient and techno-savvy national airline. 2.3. The DPE was directed to finalise the appointment of the interim board for SAA and to conclude the appointment of the Strategic Equity Partner for the restructured SAA. Mango was commended on the strategic role it played as an SAA subsidiary, to ensure the continued presence of the airline in the market. 3. National Seasonal Preparedness (Contingency) Plan for the 2020-21 Summer Season3.1. Cabinet approved the National Seasonal Preparedness Plan for the 2020-2021 Summer Season presented by the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma. The plan follows predictions which indicated that increased chances of above-normal rainfall over most parts of the country are expected. This implies that the summer rainfall areas covering all eight provinces   except the winter rainfall areas such as Western Cape   have a high expectation of floods and windstorms. 3.2. In implementing the plan, mitigating measures are put in place to reduce the impact of extreme summer seasonal hazards. This plan incorporates the festive season starting from November 2020 to February 2021, since this period prone to increased risks of weather-related hazards. Cabinet further noted that some parts of the Cape provinces are still experiencing severe drought.3.3. Cabinet calls on the public to make the necessary preparations against summer seasonal hazards and ensure effective responses that would save lives, protect property and infrastructure. 4. National Policy Development Framework4.1. Cabinet approved the National Policy Development Framework that will guide all government departments in drafting their respective public policies. The framework seeks to standardise the policy-formulation processes across all spheres of government.4.2. The document outlines the various steps to be followed in public policy formulation, which include policymaking cycles, expected standards; factors to be considered when formulating a policy and institutional arrangements to be put in place for effective policymaking and implementation processes.   4.3. The current framework does not ensure uniformity and synergy in policymaking in government. The document will be accessible through the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) website (www.dpme.gov.za). 5. Land Donations Policy5.1. Cabinet approved the policy for implementation, which aims to accelerate land donations as one of the ways to respond to the slow pace of land reform. 5.2. The implementation of the policy will create meaningful opportunities for citizens in peri-urban and rural areas to participate in the economy. It puts in place incentives and guides land donations by owners of large tracts of land. The incentives come with prescribed empowerment responsibilities on the part of big institutional land holders that will donate land.5.3. Donated land and the incentive policy measures are aligned to the agreement reached by social partners in the 2016 Operations Phakisa on Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development. The policy was released for public consultation in February 2020.6. National Policy on Beneficiary Selection and Land Allocation of 20206.1. Cabinet approved the policy, which provides for a fair, credible and transparent process for beneficiary selection and land allocation in South Africa. The policy incorporates comments received during its publication earlier in the year and sets out to address, amongst others, gender inequality in land ownership. 6.2. It prioritises the allocation of land ownership to women, thereby promoting the advancement of women in this regard. It also seeks to address the diverse land needs as expressed by communities for agricultural production, human settlements, commonage, residential and industrial development. 6.3. The policy proposes the creation of an independent structure to process the land allocations and provides for an online application system to ensure full transparency to the allocation of the land. 7. Draft One-Stop Border Post (OSBP) Policy 7.1. Cabinet approved the draft OSBP Policy for public consultation. The creation of the OSBP seeks to harmonise the movement of people and goods between South Africa s land ports of entry and its neighbouring countries. The proposals in the policy seek to address congestion which results in delays, particularly by cross-border travellers and traders. 7.2. This policy gives effect to the One-Stop Border Framework that was adopted by Cabinet in 2018. At a continental level, the policy contributes to the Presidential Infrastructure Champion Initiative, which advances interconnectivity amongst African countries to address infrastructure deficit and boost intra-Africa trade. The draft policy will be gazetted for public comment during the first quarter of 2021.8. Ratification of the International Labour Organisation Convention Concerning the Elimination of Violence and Harassment in the World of Work Convention of 2019 (No. 190)8.1. Cabinet approved the submission of the World of Work Convention of 2019 (No. 190) to Parliament for ratification. The convention addresses violence and harassment, specifically in the workplace. It provides a clear framework for action and an opportunity to shape a future of work based on dignity and respect, free from violence and harassment.8.2. Ratification of this convention is aligned to the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996. Once ratified, the provisions of the convention will be domesticated and aligned to the Labour Relations Act, 1995 (Act 66 of 1995).8.3. The Department of Employment and Labour has already developed a Code of Good Practice on the Prevention and Elimination of Violence and Harassment in the World of Work.9. Revised Antarctic and Southern Ocean Strategy9.1. Cabinet approved the revised strategy for implementation, which includes comments received during its publication earlier in the year. The strategy provides for the coordination and implementation of the Antarctic Treaties Act, 1996 (Act 60 of 1996), relating to research, conservation, sustainable resource use and environmental management in support of the African agenda.  9.2. This contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals, by recognising that the Antarctic and Southern Ocean are critical parts of the global climate system. The strategy contributes to climate action and ecological integrity by promoting the establishment of specially protected and managed areas. It was published in March 2020 for public comment.10. Human Rights, Liberation and Reconciliation: Nelson Mandela Legacy Sites Nomination Dossier 10.1. Cabinet approved submission of the Human Rights, Liberation and Reconciliation: Nelson Mandela Legacy Sites Nomination Dossier to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation s World Heritage Centre for consideration and inscription as a World Heritage Site. This is part of the broader Resistance and Liberation Heritage Route Project. 10.2. The nomination puts forward 10 individual sites in four provinces and seven municipalities. These represent our history of liberation and human rights, and provides evidence of the different phases of the struggle for freedom. 10.3. This nomination is aligned to the National Development Plan, which emphasises the conservation and restoration of protected areas. It also recognises the potential of the creative economy s contribution towards generating employment and export earnings.C. Bills 1. Preservation and Development of Agricultural Land Bill of 20201.1. Cabinet approved submission of the Bill to Parliament. The Bill repeals the Agricultural Land Act, 1970 (Act 70 of 1970) to give effect to constitutional requirements, and provide a fair and balanced approach in the use of agricultural land.1.2. The Bill proactively protects agricultural land for food production through the establishment of Protected Agricultural Areas in which high potential agricultural land will be delineated for agricultural purposes and low potential agricultural land will be permitted for non-agricultural uses. 1.3. The implementation of the Bill addresses the threat to national and household food security.D. Upcoming Events1. African Union (AU) Summit 1.1. The AU will host the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Extraordinary Summit on 5 and 6 December 2020, in preparation for the start of the AfCFTA on 1 January 2021. 1.2. The AfCFTA holds enormous benefits for South Africa as it serves as a catalyst to economic growth and investment. The free-trade area opens our exports of goods and services to a market of more than 1,2 billion people. As Chair of the AU, South Africa has been at the forefront of driving the implementation of the AfCFTA.1.3. The agreement advances economic integration and development, women empowerment on the continent, and strengthens efforts towards peace and stability in Africa.2. Reconciliation Day2.1. South Africa will commemorate Reconciliation Day on 16 December 2020 under the theme:  United in Action against Racism, Gender-Based Violence and Other Intolerances . Let us use this day to recommit ourselves towards achieving nation-building and social cohesion.2.2. This year s focus on racism underscores the importance of each person taking responsibility to fight racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in the country. 3. International Anti-Corruption Day3.1. South Africa will join the rest of the world in commemorating International Anti-Corruption Day on Wednesday, 9 December 2020. The day raises awareness about the cost and negative effects of corruption, and seeks to eliminate it. 3.2. Corruption is unacceptable, whether it occurs in the public or private sector. Corruption takes various forms and acts like  buying  a drivers licence, paying a bribe to escape lawful punishment, collusion and anti-competitive behaviour, all constitute corruption. 3.3. The success of our fight against corruption depends on the involvement of all citizens and institutions. In November 2020, Cabinet approved the National Anti-Corruption Strategy for implementation and called on everyone to form a united front in fighting corruption. If you see something, say something, report corruption by dialling the National Anti-Corruption Hotline on 0800 701 701. E. Messages1.

The 2020 exams which saw an increase in the number of learners who wrote their final examinations when compared to 2019, also saw an increase in the number of learners who attained a Bachelor s admission pass.  1.2. Cabinet wishes all the learners well as they embark on their respective post-schooling years. In addition to university studies, learners are encouraged to also explore vocational skills training that is available through Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges as part of strengthening South Africa s technical skills base that is essential for our economy. Learners who do not qualify for the TVET colleges or universities are encouraged to explore the Second- Chance Matric Programme.1.3. Cabinet also congratulated all officials and the management of the Department of Basic Education who   in addition to implementing health and safety measures at schools in 2020 to protect teachers and learners from the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic   worked tirelessly to achieve the impressive matric results.  1.4. Cabinet wishes to express its appreciation to all the teachers, school managers, officials within the basic education systems, teacher unions, learner organisations, the learners and their parents for their hard work and collective dedication to ensure that we achieve the kind of results we can be proud of despite the difficulties experienced in 2020. 1.5. Cabinet is pleased that the 2021 school year has officially started and is confident that the measures in place are sufficient for safe teaching and learning. Everyone has a responsibility to remain vigilant and to strictly adhere to health and safety protocols, which are designed to safeguard the health and safety of teachers, staff and learners. Cabinet calls on all South Africans to support our learners and to ensure that they succeed.2. State of the Nation Address (SoNA)2.1. Cabinet welcomed the 2021 SoNA that was delivered by His Excellency, President Matamela Cyril Ramaphosa, to a hybrid Joint Sitting of the two houses of Parliament   the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces   in Cape Town on Thursday, 11 February 2021.2.2. The SoNA and the President s Response to the SoNA Debate offered a progress report on the implementation of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan (ERRP) and roadmap to the impactful implementation of government s plans. Cabinet is resolute to fully implement all the commitments announced by the President.2.3.  While acknowledging the socio-economic challenges confronting us, Cabinet remains confident that they will be addressed through the implementation of the ERRP and government s Programme of Action (PoA), with a focus on achieving an inclusive growth and the goals of our Vision 2030 as set out in the National Development Plan (NDP).2.4. In spite of the setback caused by the COVID-19 pandemic that started in 2020, the overall PoA remains on track though somewhat slowed down. On Wednesday, 24 February 2021, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni outlined the budget to fund this year s plans.3. NDP Review Report3.1. Cabinet noted the report on the outcomes of the review of the NDP and will endeavour to restore progress on government s contribution towards Vision 2030. The National Planning Commission will release the NDP Review Report.4. Local vaccines development4.1. Cabinet welcomed the efforts and progress made by our scientists, researchers and medical experts towards a national initiative of developing our own vaccines to deal with current and future pandemics. Our scientists, researchers and medical experts have been at the forefront of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and have led the genomic surveillance of COVID-19 virus, which resulted in the discovery of the 501Y.V2 variant. In this regard, Cabinet would like to congratulate all the South African scientists and researchers who managed to recreate the virus in the laboratory for purposes of enhancing research on the treatment of the COVID-19 pandemic.  4.2. Cabinet believes that our national science and innovation system is a valuable resource that should be nurtured and developed. 4.3. Even beyond the research on COVID-19, South Africa s world-renowned scientists and innovators have delivered cutting-edge technology such as the world s first digital laser and the Lodox full body x-ray scanner.   5. COVID-19 vaccine roll-out5.1. Cabinet appreciated the commencement of the national roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccination programme, with the first doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine being administered to healthcare workers (HCWs) in both the public and private sectors. 5.2. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, our HCWs have been the shield that kept our nation safe. They have faced the virus head-on and have persevered against an unrelenting virus. Their selfless sacrifice has saved countless lives and our nation owes them an immense debt of gratitude. 5.3. Their vaccination will help protect them against infection and ultimately return our nation to normalcy. Cabinet is pleased that millions of additional vaccines procured from several sources will arrive at varying intervals in the coming months, beginning in March 2021.5.4. Once HCWs have been vaccinated as part of Phase 1 of the vaccination roll-out strategy, Phase 2 will focus on essential workers and vulnerable groups, which include people over the age of 60 years, people with comorbidities as well as those living in places such as nursing homes and hostels. 5.5. Citizens are reminded that vaccination is free and voluntary, and remains our best defence against the virus, coupled with the continued adherence to the health protocols of avoiding large gatherings, wearing a mask in public, sanitising hands with water and soap or a 70% alcohol-based hand sanitiser and maintaining a social distance of at least 2,5 metres. These measures are critical to the health of our nation. 6. 4th Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS)6.1. The 4th QLFS released by Statistics South Africa on Tuesday, 23 February 2021 continues to remind us of the challenges of unemployment facing the country.  Cabinet is however encouraged by the green shoots that our economy continues to demonstrate amongst the current harsh economic realities.6.2. According to the recent statistics employment increased by 333 000 jobs, with the formal sector contributing the largest (189 000 jobs) between Quarter 3 and Quarter 4 in 2020. Furthermore, there has been a decline in the number of the Not Economically Active by 890 000 in Quarter 4 in 2020 compared to Quarter 3 in 2020.6.3. Cabinet remains concerned that the rate at which the economy creates jobs remains slower than the rate the country sheds jobs by 701 000 between Quarter 3 and Quarter 4. Although Quarter 4 noted an increase in the unemployment rate, the percentage increase of 1, 7% is still lower than the Quarter 3 increase of 9% to the unemployment rate.6.4. It is disturbing that young people constitute the largest pool of the unemployed. African and coloured South Africans as well as women remain the most vulnerable groups in the economy of the country, and this strengthens government s resolve to fast-track measures to support and enable the meaningful participation of youth, women and black people in the economy of the country. This is in line with the recommitment to economic reform and transformation made by the President in the 2021 SoNA.     7. 2021 National Budget7.1. The tabling of the 2021 National Budget is an important part of South Africa s open and accountable system of democracy. Following President Ramaphosa  s SoNA, the 2021 National Budget outlines government s financial plan to support the implementation of the national PoA as outlined in the 2021 SoNA. 7.2. Cabinet welcomes the 2021 National Budget as the best available option in balancing fiscal sustainability whilst funding critical government priorities such as the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines, supporting the most vulnerable in our society through a comprehensive social assistance programme and the ERRP in order to rebuild the economy, support job creation and attract investment, albeit under a challenging economic environment.8. Copper cable theft8.1. Cabinet welcomed the recent sentencing by the Western Cape High Court of five members of a syndicate found guilty of copper cable theft to a cumulative 1 250 years  imprisonment. We congratulate our law-enforcement agencies for the arrest and successful prosecution of those who are involved in copper cable theft. 8.2. Cabinet is hopeful that the recent arrests and sentences sent a strong message that those responsible for such economic sabotage and crimes will face the full might of the law. We call on the public to report criminals to law-enforcement agencies.9. Gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF)9.1. Cabinet welcomed the arrest of the man who brutally attacked Ms Dimakatso Ratselane, the journalist of Lesedi FM.9.2. Cabinet also welcomed the sentencing of the murderer of the pregnant Tshegofatso Pule and the arrest of Nthuthuko Shoba, her boyfriend and father of her unborn child, for allegedly masterminding her murder. 9.3. Cabinet calls on the criminal justice system to ensure justice is served on behalf of Ms Ratselane, the late Ms Pule and other victims of GBVF. Ending violence against women and children requires all of us to take a stand to stop this scourge10. Southern African Development Community (SADC) Media Awards10.1.

Issues In The Environment1. Attacks and killings of police officers condemned1.1. Cabinet condemned the continued attacks and killings of police officers as not only barbaric but also a threat to national security. Members of the South African Police Service (SAPS) and other law-enforcement agencies, including private security companies, put their lives on the line daily to keep us safe; and they also deserve our support and protection.1.2. Cabinet welcomed the swift police investigation that led to the arrest of a suspect in connection with the murder of two Western Cape police officers on Sunday, 28 February 2021, who were also robbed of their firearms. All acts of criminality, including murder, will not be tolerated, and perpetrators will be hunted down and brought to book.  1.3.

On an expenditure basis, household final consumption expenditure increased at a rate of 7.5%, led by restaurants and hotels; food and non-alcoholic beverages; and recreation and culture sub-sectors. Gross fixed capital formation increased by 12.1%, led by increased investment in transport equipment and construction works as road passenger and freight activities improved and civil engineering works resumed.4.4.

The Department of Water and Sanitation has launched the #SaveWater campaign to remind all South Africans that every drop counts. Despite the recent good rainfall, the water-scarce country is still susceptible to sustained droughts exacerbated by climate change.1.3.

Cabinet remains confident of the remarkable progress being made by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) in authorising the J&J vaccine for mass vaccination. The recent approval by the SAHPRA of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine should give the country access to more lifesaving vaccines.1.5.

Cabinet further reiterated the importance of observing the non-pharmaceutical health protocols to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 by continuing to wear masks in public spaces, maintaining social distancing of at least 1,5 metres, always washing hands with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser, and avoiding large gatherings.  2.    Energy2.1. Cabinet is aware of the negative socio-economic impact, disruption and inconvenience caused by load-shedding to ordinary citizens and businesses over the past few weeks.2.2.

Cabinet welcomed the announcement by Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe of eight preferred bidders to provide an additional 2 000 megawatts of emergency electricity that will help support the national grid over the short term.2.4. The preferred bidders from the Independent Power Producer Programme are expected to source energy from solar, wind, liquefied natural gas and battery storage.

Statement on the virtual Cabinet Meeting of 21 April 2021,22 Apr 2021,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-virtual-cabinet-meeting-wednesday-21april-2021-22-apr-2021-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-virtual-cabinet-meeting-wednesday-21april-2021-22-apr-2021-0000,"A. Issues in the environment1. Temporary suspension of the Sisonke Vaccination Programme and the recommendation to lift it1.1 Cabinet was briefed on the temporary suspension of the Johnson and Johnson (J&J) Sisonke Vaccination Programme, which was a precautionary measure which allowed South Africa s scientists to review the South African data on the J&J vaccine. This followed the suspension of the J&J vaccination roll-out programme in the United States of America (USA) after six people who received the J&J vaccine developed a rare type of blood clot. Another reason for the temporary suspension was the decision by J&J to voluntarily suspend the roll-out of their vaccine in the Eurozone.1.2 The temporary suspension in South Africa was in line with government s commitment to ensure that comprehensive safety measures are undertaken regarding the vaccine roll-out. The reviewed data had confirmed that South Africa had not experienced any rare blood clots with the already vaccinated healthcare workers (HCWs).1.3 Cabinet welcomed the recommendation by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority to lift the suspension of the J&J Sisonke Vaccination Programme.1.4 Our scientists will continue to monitor all South Africans as and when they are vaccinated. By mid-April 2021, more than 292 623 HCWs had been vaccinated under the Sisonke Vaccination Programme.2. Vaccination roll-out programme2.1 Cabinet welcomed the progress in the signing of the contract with J&J on the procurement of J&J vaccines for the full roll-out programme, and commended the Minister of Health, Dr Zweli Mkhize and the Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition, Mr Ebrahim Patel, for resolving the outstanding matters relating to the procurement of the vaccines without compromising the position of South Africa.2.2 Furthermore, Cabinet welcomed the successful negotiation of an additional 10 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, which brings the total doses of the Pfizer vaccine to 30 million. This means South Africa will be able to vaccinate 15 million people with the Pfizer vaccine instead of just 10 million.2.3 To prepare for Phase 2 of the vaccination roll-out programme starting on 17 May 2021, Cabinet encourages people aged 60 years and older to register  on the Electronic Vaccination Data System: https://vaccine.enroll.health.gov.za.2.4 People without access to the internet can register in person at over 3 338 vaccination sites across the country. Mobile teams will also be deployed to assist the elderly, the homeless and people living in rural areas.3. Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) infections rates3.1 Cabinet received an update on the COVID-19 infections across the country and commended South Africans for their continued adherence to the non-pharmaceutical health protocols of wearing a mask when in public spaces, maintaining social distancing of about 1.5 metres and always washing hands with soap and water or using a 70% alcohol-based hand sanitiser. 3.2 However, the report also indicated a slight increase of 4,9% in persons testing positive in the past 14 days, by 18 April 2021. The cases increased from 14 113 in the preceding 14 days to 14 807 cases in the last 14 days.3.3 The slight increase in cases is attributed to cluster resurgences in the Free State and Northern Cape, and rapid response teams have been activated to conduct contact tracing.4. Economic recovery4.1 Cabinet welcomed the 2021 Annual Front Office Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) Omnibus Survey, which ranked South Africa first in the world as a destination for BPO.4.2 The survey extended to over 600 executives from eight key sourcing markets, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK) and the USA.4.3 This affirms the proactive work of government and the sector in building the country s BPO capacity, with a strong growth in call centres, technical support and back and front office services for major multinational and South African firms.4.4 The country s sophisticated digital infrastructure, skilled workforce, knowledge in technology and financial services, and proficiency in English, continue to make it an attractive destination for BPO.5. Job creation5.1 Cabinet is pleased that a number of government interventions to stimulate the participation of more South Africans in the economy, particularly young people, are starting to yield results.5.2 The Presidential Employment Stimulus that was launched in October 2020 to respond to the economic impact of COVID-19  created or retained 360 010 jobs by the end of February 2021, mostly  for unemployed youth. In addition, the employment stimulus has supported the livelihoods of 60 539 beneficiaries through the transfer of support, including production vouchers for subsistence farmers.5.3 Over 300 000 of these opportunities came from placing young people as assistants in schools across the country, through the Basic Education Employment Initiative. These school assistants have played an important role in strengthening the learning environment at schools during a difficult time.6. Infrastructure development6.1 Cabinet appreciated the progress made in enhancing the efficiency and competitiveness of the Port of Durban that has resulted in a significant reduction of congestion and improved turnaround times.6.2 His Excellency, President Cyril Ramaphosa, visited the Port of Durban on Thursday, 15 April 2021 to assess progress with port infrastructure improvement following his meeting with port users and stakeholders in October 2019.6.3 Improving the performance of South Africa s ports, particularly the Port of Durban, is central to government s objective of maintaining South Africa s position amongst the largest and most efficient trading ports and strengthen our position as the gateway for the region and the continent.6.4 Cabinet also welcomed the report from an oversight visit to the Saldanha Bay Harbour in the Western Cape by Public Works and Infrastructure Minister Patricia de Lille    along with Deputy Minister Noxolo Kiviet and Dr Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, Head of Investment and Infrastructure in The Presidency   on Tuesday, 6 April 2021. 6.5 The Small Harbours Repairs and Maintenance Programme, which is a Strategic Integrated Project as part of the Infrastructure Investment Plan approved by Cabinet in May 2020, is currently 77% complete. It has created  a total of 611 job opportunities and various local small, medium and micro enterprise businesses have benefited to the value of R55 million. The project is expected to be completed in March 2022.7. Monthly Statistical Reports7.1 StatsSA continues to release a number of monthly reports on the performance of various sectors of the economy. Although some sectors continue to battle with the recovery, the resilience of the agriculture, manufacturing and mining industries continues to inspire confidence in the recovery of the South  African economy.7.2 Cabinet is pleased that the implementation of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan is making noticeable impact in South Africa s recovery.8.

Hate crimes9.1 Cabinet strongly condemned the recent rise of LGBTIQ+ hate crimes that resulted in the deaths of Andile Ntuthela, Siphamandla Khoza and Nathaniel Mbele.9.2 The Bill of Rights enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996 calls on us to respect the rights of all members of society without any form of discrimination. These heinous crimes and acts of harassment have no place in our democracy, and must be condemned in the strongest possible terms by all of us.9.3 Cabinet called on anyone who may assist with the arrest and prosecution of the perpetrators of these crimes to contact the police through the toll-free number 10111 or visit the nearest police station.10.

The commencement of Phase 2 will run simultaneously with the continuing vaccination of health care workers (HCWs)whose vaccination was affected by the regulatory issues that beset the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in the USA and Europe.  The Sisonke vaccination plan which was expanded to 95 sites across the country has vaccinated to date 434,980 healthcare workers (HCWs) and will end on the 14 May 2021. Cabinet is pleased that the remainder  of the  HCWs will be vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine until further notice.1.2. Cabinet called on people who are 60 years and older to register on the COVID-19 Electronic Vaccination Data System https://vaccine.enroll.health.gov.za. Those without online access or a smartphone can register through SMS by dialling *134*832*your ID number#. If you do not have an ID number, dial *134*832#. Registration can also be done through the COVID-19 WhatsApp number by sending  REGISTER  to 0600 123 456. Citizens must ensure they enter their correct cellphone number and residential address to be able to receive information on the vaccination programme, when necessary.

The registration is essential for people to participate in the vaccination programme and allow traceability for purposes of medical follow-up should such be required in the future. 1.4.  You do not need data or airtime to access the zero-rated SMS and WhatsApp registration services. Those who encounter challenges whilst registering can call the COVID-19 hotline: 0800 029 999.1.5.

Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (IP) Rights (TRIPS) waiver on COVID-19 vaccines2.1. Cabinet welcomed the support of the United States for the WTO to  waive TRIPS on COVID-19 vaccines. 2.2. South Africa and India have been leading the initiative at the World Trade Organization (WTO) for the waiver of TRIPS.

The move has seen more than 100 countries, including China, supporting the effort to apply waivers to parts of the WTO s TRIPS.2.3. Poor access to COVID-19 have prevented majority of developing countries in particular within the African continent to make significant progress in the fight against COVID-19. Cabinet s view is that preventing nations from developing their own vaccines in the face of high mortality rate as a result of the coronavirus is morally indefensible. 2.4. In this regard, Cabinet welcomes the R3 billion commitment to transfer the latest technology for producing vaaccines and biological therapies to South Africa announced by Dr Patrick Soon-Shiong, The South African   American biotechnology entrepreneur.2.5. Cabinet applauds the active support of Dr Soon-Shiong and other philanthropists to equitable distribution of COVID 19 vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics. 2.6.

The third wave is imminent and we have the power to flatten the curve. Let us take responsibility of wearing masks in public, adhering to social distancing of at least 1,5 metres, always washing hands with soap and water or a 70% alcohol-based hand sanitiser, and avoiding public places and mass gatherings.2.  Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS)2.1 Cabinet noted the results of the QLFS for the first quarter of 2021 that show that the number of employed persons remained almost unchanged at 15,0 million, with a slight decrease of 28 000 in the first of quarter 2021. The number of unemployed persons also remained almost unchanged at 7,2 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 (increased by 8 000). The number of discouraged work-seekers increased by 201 000 (6,9%) between the two quarters, with a net increase of 164 000 in the not economically active population.2.2 These minor changes resulted in the official unemployment rate increasing by 0,1 of a percentage point from 32,5% in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 32,6% in the first quarter of 2021   the highest since the start of the QLFS in 2008.

Employment mainly increased in Finance (up by 215 000) and other industries that had job gains include Community and SocialServices (16 000), Utilities (16 000), Mining (12 000) and Manufacturing (7 000).

This follows a revised 1,4% (annualised: 5,8%) rise in real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2020.3.2 The finance, mining and trade industries were the main drivers of output on the production (supply) side of the economy, while household spending and changes in inventories helped spur growth on the expenditure (demand) side.3.3 Despite this being the third consecutive quarter of positive growth, the South African economy is 2,7% smaller than it was in the first quarter of 2020.4.  Energy security4.1 Cabinet acknowledged the frustration of South Africans with the continuing power outages due to failures in the Eskom infrastructure electricity networks.

The electricity regulation reforms have also enabled municipalities with the capacity to purchase their own power from other alternative power producers. This will alleviate pressure from the Eskom power grid.5.  Protests5.1 Cabinet condemned the recent violent protests in Soweto that resulted in the shutdown of the community and appeals to protesters to exercise calm and restraint.5.2  Although the right to peaceful protest is a vital part of a democratic society, it should be exercised within the confines of the law and not infringe on the rights of others.5.3 Government is committed to working with communities across the country to improve their living conditions.6.

All African countries require support from international partners and our development space should be respected to achieve our climate goals and ambitions, while contributing our fair share to the global effort.7.3 The meeting affirmed the need for the recognition of our different national circumstances and capacities as it is not realistic to expect Africa to meet the same timelines as developed countries to transition our economies and to disinvest from fossil fuels. This is important, especially given the high levels of inequality, unemployment and developmental needs across our Continent, particularly among women and the youth. Furthermore, we need to send a clear signal that implementation and ambition apply equally to mitigation, adaptation and support. 8. United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council Resolution on Palestinian Territories8.1 Cabinet welcomed the adoption of the UN Human Rights Council Resolution on ensuring respect for international human rights law and international humanitarian law in the Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem and in Israel.8.2 The resolution further called for the urgent establishment of an independent international commission of inquiry to investigate all alleged violations of human rights.

Upcoming Events1.  G7 Leaders  Summit 1.1 Cabinet is confident that South Africa s participation at the G7 Leaders  Summit in the United Kingdom from 11 to 13 June 2021, led by His Excellency President Cyril Ramaphosa, is an opportunity to champion a number of pressing issues for our country and the continent.1.2  Gatherings such as the G7 Leaders  Summit are important opportunities for South Africa to promote its view of a fairer and more peaceful world.

Rebuilding the economy5.1.    Cabinet welcomed the R36 billion in economic relief support from government as a second set of a package of interventions to get the country back on its feet from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and exacerbated by the unrests and destruction of business properties that took place in KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and some parts of Mpumalanga (albeit at a very small scale).5.2.

The AU is the legitimate representative of all African member states that should be consulted on such decisions.7.2.    The AU embodies the aspirations of all Africans and carries the mark of confidence in its leadership of the African peoples. Therefore, it should endeavour to take decisions  which are not in conflict with the principles of the AU Charter.7.3.    The continued occupation of Palestine by Israel remains totally unjust and shameful, and takes away the human rights of Palestinians. This unilateral decision follows the recent unjust attacks on innocent Palestinians by the Israelis in East Jerusalem and Gaza.7.4.

Cabinet welcomed the gazetting this week of the regulations that increase the threshold for embedded generation from the current one megawatt (MW) to 100 MW. In June 2021, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the amendment of Schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 2006 (Act 4 of 2006) to increase the National Energy Regulator of South Africa s licensing threshold for embedded generation projects to allow for more private generation of electricity.2.2. Companies in energy-intensive sectors will now be able to  generate their own electricity without the need for a licence. The new generation capacity will increase energy security by reducing reliance on the power grid and unlocking significant private sector investment. 3. Economic Recovery Support Package3.1.

As part of increasing the vaccination roll-out programme, Cabinet approved the vaccination of persons aged between 18 years and 35 years from 20 August 2021.1.3. Scientific evidence confirms that vaccinated people stand a better chance of surviving from COVID-19 than unvaccinated people. Therefore, we must all dispel the unfounded and misleading conspiracy theories about the vaccines and choose life by vaccinating. 1.4. Cabinet further approved the keeping of the country under the Risk-Adjusted Alert Level 3 of the national lockdown, as advised by the Ministerial Advisory Committee.

Meanwhile, Cabinet appeals to parents, learners and school governing bodies to ensure strict adherence to the wearing of masks, ventilation, social distancing and handwashing hygiene. Strict adherence to the non-pharmaceutical health protocols remains the most effective defence against the spread of the virus.1.4. By 31 August 2021, more than 12 568 525 doses of COVID-19 vaccines had been administered across the country. The increased number of vaccination sites, and extended vaccination days and the provision of free transport by provinces, will result in a significant increase in the number of people who will be fully vaccinated. 1.5. Cabinet encourages unvaccinated people in our country, especially adults and those at high risk of developing severe illness, to vaccinate as quickly as possible. 1.6. Vaccines hold good benefits for our health as they prevent serious illness, hospitalisation and death. Let us fight the virus together by spreading verified information about vaccines provided by the Department of Health and World Health Organisation.2. Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS)2.1. The recent QLFS results released by Statistics South Africa for the second quarter of 2021 showed that the unemployment rate increased by 1.8 percentage points from the 32.6% recorded in the first quarter of 2021 to 34.4% in the second quarter. 2.2. These poor results continue to bring to the fore the urgency for all sectors working with government to expedite the implementation of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan (ERRP) to deal with the devastating effects of COVID-19. The ERRP is at the heart of government s efforts to rebuild and transform the economy so as to create more jobs, especially for young people.2.3. Cabinet is encouraged by some of the sectors such as construction, trade and transport that have created new jobs during the period under review. A social compact to rebuild and transform our economy as part of a shared responsibility will ensure we recover quickly as a country.3. Gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF)3.1.

These heinous crimes were committed during the commemoration of Women s Month in August, which was the month to celebrate the strides we have made in bridging the gender inequalities in our society.  3.3. These crimes have reminded all of us that GBVF remains the biggest challenge facing the country. It requires all of us to work harder to strengthen the protection of women. 3.4. Cabinet has called on law-enforcement agencies to ensure justice is served for these women and their families. 3.5. Government has allocated at least R21 billion to drive the implementation of the National Strategic Plan on GBVF, which seeks to put an end to the scourge.  A number of interventions have been put in place to strengthen our criminal justice system. These include increasing dedicated regional courts to deal with sexual offences, strengthening our sexual offences laws and equipping our police officers with the requisite skills to deal effectively with such offences. A number of government buildings have been converted to create more shelters for women in distress.3.6. Cabinet calls on all of us to join hands in creating a safe and secure environment for women in the country. To obtain assistance and counselling on GBVF matters, call the GBV Command Centre on 0800 428 428 (0800 GBV GBV). Callers can also request a social worker from the Command Centre to contact them by dialling *120*7867# (free) from any cell phone.4. Anti-corruption campaign 4.1. Cabinet welcomed the arrest of seven suspects in connection with the recent murder of Ms Babita Deokaran, Acting Chief Director of Financial Accounting in the Gauteng health department.

Cabinet reiterated that whistle-blowers are important guardians of our democracy and clean governance, and urged people to continue exposing and reporting corruption and malfeasance without fear or favour.

The HSRM gives effect to the Hydrogen South Africa Strategy that was approved by Cabinet in 2007 to prepare the country for a hydrogen economy. The HSRM builds on what has been achieved in the past 10 years to prepare South Africa to move from research and development to manufacturing and commercialization. 1.2.    The HSRM effectively integrates all hydrogen-related technologies in various sectors of the economy and also fosters an inclusive economic growth. It positions South Africa as a destination with sustainable hydrogen economic capability and to also expand  export markets on hydrogen technologies.  1.3.    Local manufacturing of hydrogen products and components will contribute towards job creation and skills development, and also enhance economic transformation that will benefit the previously marginalised sector of society, particularly women and youth.1.4.    The HSRM also provides interventions that will contribute towards the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  It will amongst others enhance the provision of renewable energy to the main electricity grid and it proposes interventions in the Heavy-Duty Transport sector, which is one of the contributors in GHG emissions.  1.5.    The roadmap went through extensive consultation with all relevant stakeholders, including government departments, academia, private sector and science councils. It provides a coordination framework to ensure an integration of all hydrogen-related technologies and skills development for the country.

Cabinet thanked the religious formations, as well as the sports and arts fraternity, for embarking on vaccination campaigns to encourage the uptake of vaccines.  1.3.    The more people get vaccinated, the sooner the country will relax the current Adjusted Alert Level 2 restrictions. This will inevitably result in the full opening of the economy to be able to grow and create much-needed jobs.  1.4.    Cabinet reiterates the call that to   reduce new infections, we all have to continue  wearing a mask in public, washing hands with soap and water or using a 70% alcohol-based sanitiser, and maintaining a safe social distance continues to reinforce the country s approach in reducing new infections.2.    Vooma Vaccination Weekend campaign from 1 to 2 October 20212.1.    Cabinet urges unvaccinated South Africans and people living in South Africa to take advantage of the Vooma Vaccination Weekend which will take place around the country on Friday, 1 and Saturday, 2 October 2021.2.2.

Issues in the environment 1. 2021 Local Government Elections (LGE) 1.1. Cabinet thanked all eligible voters who cast their vote in the 2021 LGE on Monday, 1 November 2021. These elections marked the 21st anniversary of the establishment of a democratic local government system in South Africa. 1.2. We applaud the tolerance, dignity and patience with which the voters conducted themselves throughout Election Day. The smooth way in which political parties contested the LGE and the emergence of young candidates, especially women, is testament to our vibrant and functioning democracy. 1.3. Cabinet commended the Electoral Commission of South Africa, all political parties, members of society and the law-enforcement agencies in the country for their collective efforts to ensure the peaceful elections. Cabinet also commended the media for their important role in providing voters with relevant information to assist them in exercising their democratic right to choose their preferred local government leaders. 1.4.

Our country has already administered over 22 million vaccine doses. 2.2. Three out of every five people aged over 50 years in our country are now vaccinated.

National Treasury is working with Eskom to grant it the appropriate exemptions to acquire the spare parts needed for repairs and maintenance. Eskom is also making progress in re-employing skilled personnel   including plant managers   to help the power utility make headway at individual power stations and across various operations of the business. 3.3. Over the medium term, government is implementing a number of interventions to resolve our energy challenges and we are making every effort to bring new power generation capacity online in the shortest possible time. 3.4. The interventions include: lifting the threshold for companies to produce their own electricity without a licence to 100 megawatts (MW); the announcement of 11 successful bidders for the Risk Mitigation Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme; and Bid Window Five of the renewable energy programme to procure 2 600 MW of new generation capacity from wind and solar photovoltaic projects. 3.5. While Cabinet is aware that the current energy challenges are frustrating and counterproductive to economic growth, it is confident that the practical actions government is taking to restructure and strengthen our electricity system will eventually improve the country s energy capacity.  4. Investment 4.1. South Africa continues to perform as an investment destination of choice, attracting some of the world s top businesses to expand their operations in the country. 4.2. Toyota South Africa has launched its R2,6 billion production plant in Durban in KwaZuluNatal. The plant will manufacture the first generation of commercial-scale hybrid electric vehicles in South Africa. This is part of the Auto industry masterplan commitments by the company to increase its levels of investment. 4.3. The launch dovetails with the announcement by Swedish multinational food packaging and processing company, Tetra Pak, to invest R500 million to upgrade its production capacity of its packaging material factory in Durban. 4.4. Aspen Pharmacare opened its new anaesthetic line producing Diprivan locally as part of the R3,2-billion investment in creating world-class sterile production facilities, and turning the site in Gqeberha in the Eastern Cape into the most advanced pharmaceutical precinct on the African continent.

Cabinet also welcomed the recent investment by vehicle maker, Isuzu Motors, into the economy of the country. Isuzu Motors South Africa launched the production facility at Struandale in Gqeberha. Isuzu is investing R1.2 billion into its next generation bakkie programme in South Africa for the South African and Sub-Saharan Africa markets.  4.6. The Isuzu plant will create 1 000 direct jobs at its operations in Gqeberha, and across its national and international dealer network, and about 25 000 jobs at hundreds of suppliers across the country.   4.7. All these three investments will advance the localisation programme announced in the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan launched by His Excellency President Cyril Ramaphosa in October 2020. They will add billions of rand of annual production to South Africa s gross domestic product. Two of the investments had been pledged at the previous South Africa Investment Conference, and the firms have now commenced with production, creating a significant number of new jobs.  5. 2022 National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) applications 5.1.

Cabinet welcomed the triple life sentence handed down to rapist and murderer Mfanasibili Cornelius Mnisi (29) by the Mpumalanga Division of the High Court in Mbombela recently. This harsh sentence demonstrates the zero-tolerance approach against GBVF by the criminal justice system. 6.2. By working together with the police and other law-enforcement agencies, we can make our streets and communities safer for all. We should all be vigilant and report all GBVFrelated incidents to the police or call the National GBVF Command Centre: 0800 428 428 or Stop Gender Violence Helpline: 0800 150 150/*120*7867#. 6.3.

Cabinet welcomed the recent announcement by Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola of a special team of investigators and state prosecutors that will deal exclusively with Truth and Reconciliation Commission cold cases. 7.2.

Criminal Law (Forensic Procedures) Amendment Bill of 2021 1.1. Cabinet approved the submission of the Criminal Law (Forensic Procedures) Amendment Bill of 2021 to Parliament for processing. The proposed amendments provide for the mechanism to enforce the taking of DNA buccal samples (samples from cells on the inside of the person s cheek) from people convicted under Schedule 8 offences. 1.2.

Cabinet was pleased that over 260 000 people vaccinated during the second Vooma Vaccination Weekend held countrywide from 12 to 14 November 2021.1.2. We must remember that the virus has not been eradicated and vaccination protects us from serious illness, hospitalisation or death.1.3.

Let us vaccinate to ensure a safe and joyful festive season with our families and friends.  2. District Development Model (DDM) 2.1. Cabinet welcomed the visit by President Cyril Ramaphosa to the Ugu District in KwaZulu-Natal on Friday, 12 November 2021, which highlighted the development of the Eastern Seaboard that encompasses 600 kilometres of the coastline between KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape.   2.2. The Eastern Seaboard Development is a flagship project of the DDM, which sets out to build inclusive local economies to overcome the legacy of apartheid spatial planning. The project aims to harness the potential of the vast natural endowments of the area for economic growth. 3. Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS)3.1. Cabinet fully supported the financial path set out in the MTBPS presented by Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana in Parliament, Cape Town on Thursday, 11 November 2021, which sends a strong message of our commitment to prudent fiscal discipline.3.2.

Intra-African Trade Fair 2021 (IATF2021)4.1. The successful IATF2021   held at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre in Durban from 15 and 21 November 2021   has helped deepen cooperation and boost intra-African trade and investment. 4.2. The IATF brought together business leaders to share trade, investment, market information and broaden investment opportunities on the continent. South African goods and services were also profiled and marketed to build networks and partnerships to increase exports into the continent.  5. Household safety 5.1. Cabinet expressed concern about the safety of children following recent sporadic cases of child kidnappings in different parts of the country. During the upcoming festive season, parents and caregivers must be extra vigilant regarding the safety and whereabouts of children in their care.5.2. Parents and caregivers are urged to discuss general safety precautions with children in their care, including on COVID-19 risks and protocols. We also urge parents and caregivers to consider which activities their children, especially the youth, can safely participate in.5.3. Events such as matric rage parties and matric farewell after-parties are potential COVID-19 superspreaders. Large gatherings, especially those which involve the consumption of alcohol, are a major risk and undermine our efforts to contain the spread of the virus.6. Formation of local government coalitions6.1. Cabinet thanked all eligible voters who cast their vote in the 2021 Local Government Elections (LGE) held on Monday, 1 November 2021 to determine who should govern at local government. It also noted the coalition arrangements recently announced on those hung municipalities where there was no outright winner.6.2.

It also applauded political parties for the decorous manner in which they conducted themselves during the LGE and coalition negotiations. 7. Social cohesion 7.1. Cabinet noted the rising xenophobic sentiments and stereotypes in some parts of the country against foreign nationals.  7.2. The onslaught of COVID-19 has affected all people in South Africa and the negative sentiments being perpetuated by a handful of people do not reflect the true state of cordial relations between foreigners living and working within our communities and our citizens. 7.3. Cabinet called on communities to be vigilant and avoid being coerced into hating other fellow human beings. It called on everyone to act responsibly and within the bounds of the law. Report any act of lawlessness such as intimidation and public violence to law-enforcement agencies.B. Cabinet decisions1.

The campaign focuses on raising awareness on persons with disabilities in our society, and also celebrates the progress we have made as a country to provide space for the active participation of people with disabilities in our drive for economic growth.

The first Zimbabwean special dispensation started in 2009 and was called the Dispensation for Zimbabwe Permit. It provided for the documentation of qualifying Zimbabweans for a five-year period.6.2. In 2014, the dispensation was extended by three years and called the Zimbabwean Special Permit. The current ZEP was initiated in 2017 and comes to an end on 31 December 2021.6.3. Following its deliberations, Cabinet decided to no longer issue extensions to the Zimbabwean special dispensations. However, it decided on a 12 months grace period at the expiry of the current ZEP. 6.4.

The national departments  planning instruments or Policies and Measures (PAMs) seek to mitigate emissions from the sector in line with the sectoral emissions target.

The carbon budget allocation methodology sets out the scope of mandatory carbon budget implementation and details operational frameworks to be used to calculate and allocate company-level carbon budgets for the first mandatory phase and beyond.10. Rationalisation of magisterial districts 10.1. Cabinet welcomed the finalisation of the rationalisation of the remaining four provinces  (Eastern Cape; Free States; KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape) magisterial districts. The process, which gives effect to the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996, commenced in 2014 with magisterial districts of Gauteng and North West being rationalised. Limpopo and Mpumalanga were finalised in 2016 and Northern Cape in 2018.10.2. Prior to 1994, the country s magisterial districts were determined along racial lines, perpetuating inferior judicial services to black people living in the defunct homelands, self-governing states and townships. 10.3. The proposed reconfigured courts  jurisdiction boundaries ensure equal access to the justice system by all South Africans. The process to finally come up with these boundaries was an all-inclusive  process that included the magistracy, South African Police Service; National Prosecuting Authority; Legal Aid Board, Municipal Demarcation Board and all relevant stakeholders in the respective provinces. 11. State litigation management, mediation and state legal representation policies 11.1. Cabinet approved three policies pertaining to the management of state litigation, mediation and state legal representation. These policies seek to promote a professionally  empowering and cost-effective management of state litigation cases. 11.2. The policies provide general principles to be observed and the approach to be adopted by the Office of the State Attorney (OSA) when dealing with state litigation matters. Also, the policies establish uniform procedures and provide a framework to assist the OSA. The mediation policy also introduces alternative interventions on cases that can be resolved at less costly court processes.11.3.

The amendments, amongst others, give effect to the universal access to the two years of early childhood development.1.3. The Bill also enforces accountability within school governing bodies, and clarifies the admission, language and code of conduct policies in schools. The proposed amendments will improve access to education for all learners across the country.1.4. The Bill has gone through public consultation and also with all relevant stakeholders. 2.

It also imposes a compulsory deposit insurance premium on registered members of a corporation to provide a safety net for the depositors in the event of the bank s failure.2.3. The Bill also amends the Pension Funds Act, 1956 (Act 24 of 1956); the Banks Act, 1990 (Act 94 of 1990); Mutual Banks Act, 1993 (Act 124 of 1993) and the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, 2002 (Act 37 of 2002) and aligns them with the FSR Act of 2017 in respect of financial-sector bodies.3. Electoral Amendment Bill 3.1. Cabinet approved the much-awaited Electoral Amendment Bill for submission to Parliament. The Bill amends the Electoral Act of 1998 to make provision for the election of independent candidates to the National Assembly and provincial legislatures. 3.2. In June 2020 the Constitutional Court ordered Parliament to remedy the defect in the current Electoral Act of 1998 to ensure independent candidates can   stand for election to the National Assembly and provincial legislatures.3.3.

Issues of the environment1.  International Anti-Corruption Day1.1.  South Africa joins the rest of the world in commemorating International Anti-Corruption Day on Thursday, 9 December 2021 under the theme  Corruption-free future starts today, it starts with me . The United Nations theme for the 2021 International Anti-Corruption Day is:  Your right, your role: Say no to corruption .1.2.  Corruption, whether large or small, remains one of the greatest challenges facing the country and holds back economic growth and social development. 1.3.  Cabinet remains encouraged that the justice system continues to take decisive steps to bring those who were found to have been involved in acts of corruption to account. The Commission of Inquiry into allegations of State Capture, Corruption and Fraud in the Public Sector, including Organs of State, is scheduled to submit its final report to President Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday, 1 January 2022.  1.4.  Cabinet anticipates that in addition to exposing the perpetrators of corruption, this report will also provide us with proposals to strengthen our systems to prevent corruption.1.5.  As part of our ongoing fight against corruption, the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) instituted a number of cases in the High Court and Special Tribunal and the following are pending as at 31 March 2021: 56 Cases in the High Court which involve contracts in the amount of R62bn;64 Cases in the Special Tribunal which involve contracts in the amount of R6.99bn. The amounts or values are the contractual amounts which were irregularly and unlawfully awarded by the state institutions and which form the subject of the litigation by the SIU. In the financial year 2021/2022, the SIU has already frozen pension benefits of former civil servants, bank accounts and assets of individuals and business amounting to more than R43 billion. he President has signed a total of 9 SIU Proclamations in the financial year under review. 1.6.  Cabinet reiterated that the success of our fight against corruption depends on the involvement of all people in South Africa. If you see something, say something; report corruption by dialling the National Anti-Corruption Hotline on 0800 701 701. 1.7.  Cabinet reaffirmed its commitment to protect whistle-blowers, and applauded the bravery of honest public servants who expose fraud and corruption, at times at the risk of their livelihoods and lives. 2.  Rapid increase in Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) infections2.1.  Cabinet noted the rapid increase in COVID-19 infections in various parts of South Africa and urged all people in the country to take stronger action to fight back against the disease and its variants. Our COVID-19 infections recorded in the last 24 hours stands at 19 842, which translates into a 26.8% positivity rate. We have also lost 36 people to COVID-19 related complications in the last 24 hours. 2.2.  Vaccination does not only help us fight back against the deadly pandemic by preventing serious illness, hospitalisation or even death, but it also reduces the health risks posed by future variants. 2.3.  We must continue adhering to the non-pharmaceutical prevention measures of wearing a mask that covers our mouth and nose; maintaining social distancing, and regularly washing our hands with soap and water or using a 70% alcohol-based hand sanitiser. 2.4.  We can also prevent the spread of the virus by avoiding superspreader events such as festivals and parties. Together we can fight back by being responsible and always acting in the best interests of protecting the health of our loved ones and our nation against COVID-19.  2.5.  Cabinet joined President Ramaphosa in applauding our scientists for having alerted the world about the Omicron variant that has been spreading around the world. Cabinet continues to support calls for the immediate lifting of unfair travel bans imposed on South Africa.  3.  Vooma Vaccination Week3.1.  We have administered a total of 26, 781, 642 vaccine doses to date. During the extended Vooma Vaccination Week campaign from 3 to 10 December 2021, thousands of people are being vaccinated at various vaccination sites that are open throughout the country. Cabinet has urged people aged 12 and older to vaccinate without delay.  3.2.  Keep yourself and your loved ones safe this festive season by simply going to your nearest vaccination site, even without an appointment, to be registered and vaccinated for free.3.3.  The health benefits of being vaccinated include a much lower risk of hospitalisation after being infected with COVID-19. Cabinet encourages all people in South Africa to respond to the clarion call to vaccinate because statistics show that the majority of people being admitted in hospitals are unvaccinated.4.  Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS)4.1.  Government remains resolute in addressing unemployment as one of the major challenges facing the country. Statistics South Africa s recent QLFS results which showed a 0,5 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate from 34,4% in the second quarter to 34,9% in the third quarter of 2021 are disturbing. 4.2.  Government continues in its target-driven work to restore business confidence by addressing the structural constraints to economic growth, job creation and poverty eradication. Through specific interventions such as large investments in infrastructure, it is working to support structural transformation, economic growth and job creation.4.3.  Through the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, government continues to support local production, including the revival of South Africa s manufacturing industry. The annual South Africa Investment Conference (SAIC) continues to attract potential investors. Since its first inaugural conference in 2018, the SAIC has so far secured more than R770 billion in investment commitments across a wide range of economic sectors. 4.4.  Cabinet remains committed to working with all sectors to address the triple challenge of unemployment, poverty and inequality. Government will do whatever is possible to create a conducive environment for investment in the country. It will also drive economic transformation to enable greater economic opportunities to the previously disadvantaged groups. 5.  Presidential Four-Nation Visit to West Africa5.1.  President Ramaphosa recently led a delegation of Ministers and business leaders with a view to grow economic relations and people-to-people interaction between South Africa and Nigeria, C te d Ivoire, Ghana and Senegal. 5.2.  This four-nation visit from 30 November to 7 December 2021 reinforced South Africa s bilateral relations to strengthen partnerships directed at African development and cooperation in multilateral forums.5.3.  South Africa and the partner states explored ways to leverage the opportunities presented by the African Continental Free Trade Area for mutual benefit, and with greater support for businesses conducting intra-African trade and investment.6.  16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children6.1.  As the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children campaign draws to an end, it remains a disturbing reality that more still needs to be done to eradicate gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF) in our society.6.2.  Many harrowing GBVF-related stories, including the loss of lives, have been reported during this period and throughout the entire extended 365 Days of Activism campaign.6.3.  We are failing as a nation when the cries of the most vulnerable in our society remain unheard or ignored. The irresponsible societal norms which validate the violent behaviour of men and the tendency to victimise women who break their silence must stop. 6.4.  Cabinet appealed to everyone, especially men, to take a stand and play an active role in ending the scourge of violence against women and children. Men must lead by speaking out against GBVF and reporting it to law-enforcement agents. They must also raise awareness, and engage in peer education and efforts to prevent GBVF. 6.5.  In order to improve our response to sexual offences and gender-based violence, government has 106 Sexual Offences Courts and now moving to the introduction of Statutory Sexual Offences Courts. 6.6.  In February 2020, section 55A of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act was signed into operation meaning that for the first time Sexual Offences Courts will now be established in accordance with a statute. Section 55A of the Act empowers the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services to designate, not only a selected regional court, but also any Division of the High Court, as a Sexual Offences Court.6.7.  Cabinet urged all sectors of society to collaborate with government to create safer communities and protect victims of abuse. It will only change if we all act, and the time to act is now!B. Cabinet decisions1.  Extension of the National State of Disaster 1.1.  Cabinet approved a recommendation by the National Coronavirus Command Council to further extend the National State of Disaster to 15 January 2022, in terms of Section 27 (5) (c) of the Disaster Management Act, 2002 (Act 57 of 2002).1.2.  The National State of Disaster is aimed at responding to the special circumstances presented by the COVID-19 pandemic2.  Festive Season safety2.1.  While most of us will be taking a well-deserved festive break, we must remember that COVID-19 does not take a holiday. A safe holiday period for you and your loved ones can be guaranteed by a simple jab at your nearest vaccination site. 2.2.  Cabinet calls on everyone to continue to be vigilant and avoid large social gatherings. Together we can make the festive season joyous and safe for everyone by not drinking and driving. We must obey all the rules of the road, including driving within the legal speed limits. Let us all make an effort to Arrive Alive. 2.3.

In the coming weeks respective Ministers will unpack government s Programme of Action for 2022, which will be informed by the National Budget Speech to be tabled on Wednesday, 23 February 2022 as well as the budget votes of all government departments.2.

Cabinet appealed to all citizens and people who live in the country to participate in Census 2022, which began on Thursday, 3 February 2022 and continues until Monday, 28 February 2022. 2.2. This is the fourth post-democracy population count and the last one was conducted in 2011.

Digital computer-assisted counting is only applicable to those who registered  on line before the 5th February.3. Update on the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) 3.1. Cabinet applauded South Africans for their continued determination in the fight against COVID-19, which helped keep new infections relatively low despite the menace of the fourth wave.3.2. COVID-19 remains a part of our lived experience, and all health and safety protocols must be followed at all times, including maintaining social distancing, washing and sanitising hands, and wearing a mask in public that covers both the mouth and nose. As the deadly virus continues to claim lives, vaccination remains our best defence. The more people vaccinate, the more safer we will be as a nation.3.3. As the country gradually returns to normality with the economy reopening and schools having resumed daily attendance and full-time learning, Cabinet called on all unvaccinated persons over the age of 12 to vaccinate as soon as possible. You only need to present yourself at any vaccination site, even without an appointment, to be registered and vaccinated for free.3.4. Cabinet also encouraged those who are fully vaccinated to go for a booster shot, which helps increase antibody levels to effectively neutralise COVID-19 variants. Booster shots are available to anyone who received their last and primary dose at least six months ago. By being up to date with vaccinations, we do not only reduce the risk of serious illness, hospitalisation and death, but we also reduce the risk of future deadly variants.4. Judicial Commission of Inquiry into State Capture Report 4.1. Cabinet noted the recent handover of the first and second parts of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into State Capture Report to President Ramaphosa as an important milestone in the fight against corruption. 4.2.

Gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF)6.1. As part of the country s fight against GBVF, President Ramaphosa recently signed into law three Acts that strengthen efforts to end GBVF   the Criminal and Related Matters Amendment Act, Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act and Domestic Violence Amendment Act.6.2.

Cabinet looks forward to the speedy enforcement of these laws to provide greater protection to victims of violence and abuse. 6.4. Remember to report incidents of GBVF to your local police station, through the toll-free Crime Stop number: 086 00 10111 or 24-hour GBV Command Centre hotline: 0800 428 428. 7.

However, after noting that some of the key departments dealing with COVID-19 had not yet concluded their analysis, Cabinet approved the final  extension of the National State of Disaster to 15 March 2022, in terms of Section 27(5)(c) of the Disaster Management Act, 2002 (Act 57 of 2002).4.

The budget demonstrates government s commitment to fiscal discipline and consistent economic management, and its cherished objective of funding critical priorities which provide socio-economic support to vulnerable South Africans.1.4.

Update on the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)3.1. Cabinet applauded South Africans for their continued determination in the fight against COVID-19, and also cautioned that the current low rates of infections and deaths should not mislead people to become careless.  South Africa has already administered over 31 million doses of the vaccines, which resulted in almost 17 million adults being fully vaccinated.3.2. Cabinet emphasised that COVID-19 has not yet been defeated and with winter approaching, people must remain vigilant and continue with the non-pharmaceutical interventions of regularly washing or sanitising hands, wearing a mask in public that covers both the mouth and nose, keeping a safe social distance and opening windows for proper ventilation.3.3. Above all else, vaccination remains the best defence against COVID-19 and future variants, as it drastically reduces the risk of serious illness, hospitalisation and even death.  3.4. Cabinet also welcomed the announcement of additional changes in the current vaccination programme, which again seek to ensure the accessibility of vaccines. Starting from Wednesday, 23 February 2022, the waiting intervals between the first and second dose have been reduced from 42 days to 21 days.3.5. Also, people will now be able to use a different booster vaccine from the primary vaccine used or even be able to use the same vaccine from the primary vaccine to the booster vaccine dose.3.6. The eventual return to normal life and full participation in socio-economic activities depends significantly on the number of vaccinated people.

We call on those with legitimate concerns to raise them with the relevant authorities so that they can be addressed constructively.  6.3.

Statement on the Cabinet Meeting of 23 March 2022,25 Mar 2022,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-23-march-2022-25-mar-2022-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-23-march-2022-25-mar-2022-0000,"A. Issues in the environment1. National State of Disaster1.1. The South African Government responded to the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) global pandemic by declaring the National State of Disaster in March 2020, in terms of the Disaster Management Act, 2002 (Act 57 of 2002). This facilitated an integrated and coordinated response to save lives and livelihoods.1.2. The country has been under regulations of the National State of Disaster on COVID-19 since March 2020, when South Africa recorded its first cases of the virus. The President has announced further interventions that are meant to get the country to embark on a new phase in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic.1.3. The recent extension of the National State of Disaster to 15 April 2022 takes into consideration the need to continue augmenting the existing legislation and contingency arrangements undertaken by organs of state to address the impact of the disaster.1.4. Cabinet has called for the consideration of health regulations to regulate non-pharmaceutical safety measures such as the wearing of masks, social distancing, limits for gatherings and vaccinations. They will also allow us to set up emergency, rapid and effective response systems to mitigate the severity of COVID-19.2. COVID-19 vaccination2.1. Cabinet reminded all people in South Africa to remain vigilant as COVID-19 has not yet been defeated, and called on those aged 12 years and older to vaccinate. Vaccination remains our best defence against the virus, and reduces the risk of serious illness, hospitalisation and death.2.2. Although infections and deaths currently remain low, we face a possible fifth wave in the coming weeks. The only defence we have is the scientific evidence showing the power of vaccines to save lives. Our country has already administered over 33 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccines.2.3. Cabinet further welcomed the Code of Practice on the management of COVID-19 exposure in the workplace issued by the Department of Employment and Labour. The Code of Practice was developed following public consultation with the National Economic Development and Labour Council and will take effect when the National State of Disaster is lifted.2.4. The Code of Practice will guide employers and employees in conducting or updating a risk assessment plan to limit COVID-19 infections in the workplace. It lists measures such as vaccination, social distancing and personal hygiene to safeguard workspaces.3. South Africa Investment Conference (SAIC)3.1. Cabinet welcomed delegates from across the country and world to the fourth SAIC taking place on Thursday, 24 March 2022 in Johannesburg.3.2. The conference is showcasing the many investment opportunities and comparative advantages that South Africa offers investors, in a period of growing African integration through the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which promotes intra-African trade.3.3. Local and foreign investments play an important role in growing our economy and creating sustainable jobs. The SAIC spurs a cycle of economic activity, employment and consumer demand that can support the growth trajectory of the country.3.4. Our past investment conferences have attracted a total of R774 billion in commitments. Of the 152 investment projects announced, 45 have already been completed and a further 57 are under construction.3.5. Cabinet is confident that this year s conference will build on our investment tally, as part of our nation s drive to attract R1.2 trillion in investment over five years. 4. Impact of the Russia and Ukraine conflict on the economy4.1. Cabinet is considering the impact the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine will have on the country s economy, as its effects are being felt on financial markets and prices across the world.4.2. The best way to protect our economy and welfare of our people is to proceed with the implementation of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan (ERRP).4.3. Government is committed to using all of the levers at our disposal to cushion South Africans from the effects of the rising cost of living and ensure that our economy withstands these turbulent times.5. Auction of the high-demand radio frequency spectrum5.1. Cabinet welcomed the successful conclusion of the country s first auction of the high-demand radio frequency spectrum by the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa. The R14.4-billion revenue collected from the auction will go to the national fiscus to support our national priorities, which include rebuilding the economy, creating much-needed jobs, and fighting corruption, crime and gender-based violence and femicide.5.2. The availability of additional high-demand spectrum will speed up the roll-out of new technologies such as 5G, reduce the cost of mobile data and ensure greater internet connectivity. The licensing of the new spectrum is accompanied by agreed social obligations to connect public schools, health facilities and police stations over the next three years.6. Human Rights Day6.1. Cabinet thanked all South Africans for joining in the country s Human Rights Day celebrations on Monday, 21 March 2022 under the theme:  The Year of National Unity and Renewal: Promoting and Protecting our Human Rights. 6.2. Advancing human rights in our country is a catalyst for nation-building, which is a process we must continue to nurture and defend at all times. Through our diversity, we can strengthen our unity and build a cohesive society.6.3. In the continuing spirit of working together, as we move towards Freedom Month in April, Cabinet called on all South Africans to renew our fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and all related intolerances in their area of influence.7. Appointment of the Chief Justice of South Africa7.1. Cabinet noted and congratulated the former Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo on being appointed as the new Chief Justice of South Africa, with effect from 1 April 2022, and wished him well in his new responsibilities.7.2. Cabinet further noted President Cyril Ramaphosa s intention to nominate Justice Mandisa Maya, the President of the Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa, for the position of Deputy Chief Justice when it becomes vacant.8. Interim order granted on humantarian aid to the Republic of Cuba8.1. Cabinet has noted the interim order granted in the Pretoria High Court, pausing implementation of the humanitarian aid that South Africa had agreed to provide to the Republic of Cuba. The matter will again be before the courts in 20 days  time and government will present its argument then.8.2 South Africa s bonds of friendship with Cuba are deeply rooted in our region s struggle for liberation. Were it not for the selfless intervention of the Cubans in Southern Africa over three decades, it would have taken far longer to liberate this region from colonial oppression. Former President Nelson Mandela understood this, which is why Cuba was the first country outside the continent Madiba visited upon his release from prison in 1990.8.3. Cuba made monumental sacrifices to fight alongside African liberation movements at a time when the small island nation had been struggling under the United States  economic embargo for a decade and a half. Cuba s economic crisis has become untenable and the Cuban Government is in need of assistance. Mexico, Bolivia and Russia are among the countries which have provided humanitarian aid to ease the island s worst economic crisis in decades.8.4. Cabinet this week joins in commemorating the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale in Angola that took place from 1987 to 1988. Cuba played the critical role in assisting African liberation movements to realise their objectives. There was no material gain for the Cubans who came to our support, but their overriding incentive was to fight for the liberation of Southern Africa from colonial and reactionary forces. Then President Fidel Castro was driven by revolutionary zeal and he told his comrades they were fighting  the most beautiful cause of mankind . From Angola to Namibia and Algeria to Guinea Bissau, Cuba played a decisive role in contributing to the liberation of these African countries from colonial occupation.8.5. Cuba has continued to consistently provide medical and other assistance to South Africa in the post-1994 period, most recently during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is our moral obligation to show solidarity with the people of Cuba at a time when they are struggling to survive.9. Visit by His Majesty King Letsie III 9.1. Cabinet noted and welcomed the courtesy call from His Majesty King Letsie III of the Kingdom of Lesotho to President Ramaphosa that took place on Friday, 18 March 2022 in Pretoria.9.2. President Ramaphosa, in his capacity as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Facilitator to the Kingdom of Lesotho, exchanged views with His Majesty King Letsie III on bilateral relations and progress regarding the SADC facilitation process in the Kingdom of Lesotho. It is envisaged that Basotho, through the facilitation of President Ramaphosa, will work in earnest to complete the reforms process before holding the next general elections scheduled for September 2022.B. Cabinet decisions1. Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS MLI)1.1. Cabinet approved the submission of the BEPS MLI to Parliament for ratification. As one of the 95 countries participating in the convention initiated by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to reduce opportunities for tax avoidance and base erosion by multinational companies, South Africa signed the tax treaty in June 2017. Once the tax treaty is ratified, South Africa will apply it alongside other tax treaties it has signed with other countries.1.2. South Africa is a member of the OECD and is committed to working with other countries to stop company profits being artificially shifted out of the country to low or no tax environment.2. Amendment of the Tax Treaty Protocol between South Africa and Kuwait2.1. Cabinet approved the submission of the amended Tax Treaty Protocol signed between South Africa and Kuwait to Parliament. Amendments to this treaty, which came into force in 2006, were made and signed in 2021.2.2. The tax protocol deals with the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income between the two countries.2.3. Apart from dealing with tax evasion, such treaties seek to encourage tax transparency between countries.3. Integrated Crime and Violence Prevention Strategy (ICVPS)3.1. Cabinet approved the ICVPS for implementation. The strategy will serve as an implementation tool of the White Paper on Safety and Security adopted in 2016. It advocates for a whole of government and society approach in fighting crime and preventing violence.3.2. The ICVPS consists of six interdependent and interrelated pillars namely, (1) an effective criminal justice; (2) early interventions in preventing crime; (3) victim support interventions; (4) effective and integrated service delivery; (5) safety through environmental design and (6) active public and community participation.The strategy acknowledges the need for complimentary interventions to address the drivers of crime such as poverty, inequality, unemployment, social welfare health and education.3.3. It is inclusive in terms of both urban and rural areas, including traditional councils, as stakeholders.  It has been fully consulted with all the spheres of government, business, research institutions and civil-society organisations. The approved strategy replaces the current National Crime Prevention Strategy.4. South Africa s Country Investment Strategy (CIS)4.1. Cabinet approved the publication of the CIS for public comment. The strategy seeks to position the country as a key African investment destination of choice by leveraging quality foreign and domestic direct investments.4.2. The strategy is anchored on the country s priority investment and economic development sectors such as (i) finance, insurance, real estate and business services; (ii) transport and logistics, (iii) manufacturing; (iv) mining and quarrying, (v) electricity, gas and water, and (vi) agriculture and agro-processing.4.3. It provides investment mechanisms to attract small, medium and micro enterprises into the economic growth drive. The strategy also taps into a number of multilateral, regional and bilateral agreements which South Africa has signed.4.4. The strategy is aligned to the goals of the National Development Plan, ERRP, Re-imagined Industrial Strategy and the recently adopted National Infrastructure Plan 2050.4.5. The nine provinces and their eight respective metropolitan key economies are central in driving the strategy, which will be a living document that will constantly be adaptable to the changing economic environment.5. Revised National Biodiversity Framework (NBF)5.1. Cabinet approved the NBF for implementation. The NBF, which Cabinet approved for public consultation in November 2020, was developed in line with the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act, 2004 (Act 10 of 2004). It provides for an integrated, coordinated and uniform approach to biodiversity management by all organs of state, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the private sector and communities.5.2. In 2018, the South African National Biodiversity Institute conducted a comprehensive scientific assessment of the state of biodiversity and ecosystem in South Africa. The revised NBF sectoral plan of action addresses the threats identified from this assessment. 5.3. The revised framework was consulted with all the spheres of government; state-owned entities (SOEs), conservationist entities; NGOs and local communities. The implementation of the NBF is guided by the adopted National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2015-2025). South Africa is a signatory to the  United Nations  Convention on Biological Diversity, which promotes the conservation of biological diversity, sustainable use of its components, and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources.6. Draft National Spatial Development Framework (NSDF)6.1. Cabinet approved the draft NSDF for implementation. It was prepared in terms of the Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act, 2013 (Act 16 of 2013) and approved for public consultation in 2019. Inputs were obtained from various stakeholders, including professional bodies, all spheres of government, SOEs and members of the public.6.2. The framework seeks to deal with the eradication of the colonial and apartheid spatial legacies in an orderly and coordinated manner. It provides a long-term spatially focused developmental approach towards planning and a land use management system. The document will be accessible through the website of the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (www.dalrrd.gov.za).7. Official Identity Management Policy7.1. Cabinet approved the Official Identity Management Policy, following an extensive public consultation in 2021. This policy will  replace  the current Identification Act, 1997 (Act 68 of 1997), which establishes the National Population Register (NPR) and also specify its scope in the mandatory records that are captured on it. This Act is not aligned to the constitutional principles of equality, non-discrimination and human dignity.7.2. The adopted policy proposes a single digital NPR of all people   irrespective of citizenship and sex status   who live and have lived in the country. It also provides for a biometric National Identity System (NIS) that will enable a single view of a person. The NIS will also be able to interface with other government and private sector identity systems. 7.3. The policy will also ensure the protection of the rights of members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex, Queer and Asexual community.8. White Paper on Marriages in South Africa8.1. Cabinet approved the White Paper on Marriages in South Africa for implementation.  The White Paper responds to many court judgements that have found some elements of the current marriage legislation to be unconstitutional. It has aligned all marriages to be concluded in accordance with the principles of equality, non-discrimination and human dignity as provided for in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996.8.2. The approved White Paper will allow South Africans and residents of all sexual orientations, religious and cultural persuasions to conclude legal unions in line with the constitutional principles. The White Paper outlines some of the unions that are excluded such as child marriages and those done in the absence of the other party9. One-Stop Border Post (OSBP) Policy9.1. Cabinet approved the OSBP and its implementation strategy. The policy seeks to harmonise the movement of people and goods between South Africa s land ports of entry and its neighbouring countries. It gives effect to the One-Stop Border Framework that was adopted by Cabinet in 2018.9.2. The application of the policy will alleviate current congestions at our land ports of entry for cross-border travellers and traders. These interventions are also key in the country s efforts in driving the AfCFTA agreement.9.3.  Once fully operationalised with relevant legislation and infrastructure upgrades, we envisage that the processing of goods, vehicles and people will be done in a seamless and faster manner.10. Interim hosting of the Presidential Climate Commission10.1. Cabinet approved the transitional hosting of the Presidential Climate Commission by the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac). Nedlac will host the commission with its secretariat for two years or shorter to enable the promulgation of the Climate Change Act.10.2. The period will also afford the commission   in collaboration with the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment   to finalise the feasibility study and business case for the future establishment of the commission as determined by the Climate Change Bill.11. Draft White Paper on National Rail Policy11.1. Cabinet approved the draft White Paper on National Rail Policy. The policy will guide in creating an efficient transport system that will be able to compete locally and internationally.11.2. The policy proposes focused interventions that will promote investments in both the feight and passenger services. It will also improve rural access and increase mobility to promote economic growth. It will also contribute substantially towards reducing the country s emissions as it proposes rail genetic technologies in upgrading the rail stock.11.3. The policy will be made public once the Department of Transport has published it in the Government Gazette.C. Bill1. Independent Municipal Demarcation Authority (IMDA) Bill of 20221.1. Cabinet approved the submission of the IMDA Bill of 2022 to Parliament for further processing. The Bill was published for public comment in June 2020 and subsequent engagements on the comments received from the public.1.2. The Bill provides the governance regime of the IMDA. Its proposals include clarifying the terms of the Board members and that they are to serve on a part-time basis, except for the Chairperson who may serve on a full-time basis. It also guides the IMDA on the process towards the delimiting of boundaries.D. Upcoming event1. Visit to the Middle East1.1.

Issues in the environment1.    Fourth South Africa Investment Conference (SAIC)1.1.  Cabinet welcomed the successful conclusion of the fourth SAIC held at the Sandton Convention Centre, Johannesburg on Thursday, 24 March 2022, which saw domestic and international investors pledging new investments in our country.1.2.  Our country received 80 new investment pledges totalling R332 billion. This takes the total investments pledged to R1.14 trillion, which not only represents 95 percent of our investment target but also places us firmly on the path to exceed our R1.2 trillion investment target over five years. 1.3.  These investment commitments affirm our country s status as an investment destination of choice.1.4.  So far, R316 billion of the commitments have been invested in 46 projects that have been completed and a further 57 projects that are still under construction. Cabinet notes the successes of past pledges as reported at the Conference, covering among others new production capacityin sectors as diverse as automobiles, food production, pharmaceuticals and digital centres.1.5.  Cabinet called on all sectors of society to support these critical interventions as we work together to reverse our unemployment rate, which climbed to 35.3 percent, according to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey results released recently by Statistics South Africa. 2.  Lifting of the National State of Disaster 2.1.  Cabinet also welcomed the lifting of the National State of Disaster announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday, 4 April 2022. This milestone was made possible by the resilience of people in South African who complied with all Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) safety protocols designed by government to save lives and livelihoods.2.2.  The pandemic will henceforth be managed in terms of the National Health Act, 2003 (Act 61 of 2003). The draft health regulations that will inform the National Health Act of 2003 are open for public comment until 16 April 2022. 2.3.  Cabinet reminded all people in the country to continue taking the necessary preventative measures to safeguard ourselves and others against COVID-19 infections. This includes regularly washing our hands with water and soap or using a 70% alcohol-based sanitiser, wearing a mask that covers both the nose and mouth when indoors, keeping a safe social distance of at least one metre, opening windows for ventilation and vaccinating.2.4.  COVID-19 vaccinations are effective in preventing serious illness, hospitalisation and even death. Protect yourself and your loved ones by visiting your nearest vaccination site to get vaccinated for free, even without an appointment.3.  Migration to digital broadcasting3.1.  The deferment on the Analogue Switch-off Date from 31 March to 30 June 2022 provides sufficient time to government to complete the installation of set-top boxes (STBs) for households that have registered timeously and are entitled to receive them before the analogue switch-off.3.2.  The Department of Communications and Digital Technologies will ensure that all the 507 251 households that registered by 31 October 2021 are connected no later than 30 June 2022. The 260 868 households that registered between 31 October 2021 and 10 March 2022 will be connected to their STBs by 30 September 2022.3.3. Cabinet is confident that the completion of this process will support the process of digital migration and the subsequent release of the high frequency spectrum.4.  Fighting crime and corruption 4.1. Cabinet congratulated the country s new National Commissioner of Police, General Sehlahle Fannie Masemola, following his recent appointment by President Ramaphosa.

The rulings, which demonstrate the effective coordinated approach of the NPA and the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation of the South African Police Service, send a strong message about the growing capacity of government to deal with State Capture and ensure accountability for those involved   and to seize, recover and return stolen money.4.4.  In holding those involved in corruption accountable, Cabinet also welcomed the judgement by the Palm Ridge Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Gauteng against a former Eskom financial controller for defrauding the power utility of R35 million by loading fake invoices for coal transport and the initiatives to recover the stolen monies. 4.5.  As an important milestone in our nation s fight against corruption, Cabinet welcomed     the handover of the fourth part of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into State Capture Report. President Ramaphosa will present to Parliament interventions to implement the commission s recommendations when he submits the full report by 30 June 2022. 5.  Southern African Development Community (SADC) Extraordinary Organ Troika Summit5.1.

Economy 6.1.  Cabinet welcomed credit rating agency Moody s upgrade of its outlook on South Africa to stable from negative and the decision to affirm South Africa s long-term foreign and local currency debt ratings at  Ba2 . 6.2.  The upgrade affirms the work of government to restore sustainability to the country s public finances, which is supported by better-than-expected revenue collection. 6.3.  Revenue results for the period April 2021 to March 2022, showed that the South African Revenue Service collected more than R1.5 trillion. It represents a 25 percent improvement over the previous year and a 15 percent increase over the last year prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.6.4.  Government is using the additional revenue to accelerate debt stabilisation and address urgent social needs, promote job creation through the Presidential Youth Employment Initiative, and support the public health sector.7.  Freedom Month7.1.  South Africa this year celebrates Freedom Month in April with renewed hope for a better tomorrow, having endured two sombre years under the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Cabinet approved the 20 months extension period for the merging of the two entities, the SEFA and CBDA, into the SEDA. The merger was initially set to be effective from 1 April 2022. This was after Cabinet approved the mergers to ensure government provides a single entity that will support its work in supporting small to medium enterprises and cooperatives.2.2. The approved extension will enable the Department of Small Business Development to finalise the legislative review to provide a proper legislated and policy environment that allows the formation of the single entity   SEDA. A single and well-resourced entity will provide a more streamlined support to small to medium enterprises and cooperatives. Cabinet also approved the appointment of the interim Boards of Directors for the SEFA and SEDA.3.

United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 2020-2025 4.1.  Cabinet approved South Africa s UNSDCF 2020-2025 for implementation. The framework provides an accountability partnership between government, the broader society and the UN s country office in South Africa. 4.2.

These strategic pillars are interlinked with the country s National Development Plan:  Vision 2030 and the Medium Term Strategic Framework, and also with the UN Sustainable Development Goals driven through the UN country s office in South Africa. The implementation will be done through a joint resource mobilisation strategy.5.    National intervention in the Mangaung Metropolitan and Enoch Mgijima Local municipalities5.1.  Cabinet approved the intervention in terms of Section 139(7) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996, read together with Section 150 of the Municipal Finance Management Act, 2003 (Act 56 of 2003), in the Mangaung Metropolitan and Enoch Mgijima Local municipalities. Both municipalities have been experiencing significant financial and service delivery failures for a prolonged period. 5.2.  The Free State Provincial Executive placed the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality under a mandatory intervention in terms of Section 139(5) (a) and (c) of the Constitution in December 2019. A mandatory financial recovery plan was subsequently imposed on the municipality in 2020. After failing for more than two years to implement the financial recovery plan during the provincial intervention, the Metro has now been placed under a national intervention in terms of Section 139(7) of the Constitution.5.3.  The Enoch Mgijima Local Municipality was also placed under mandatory intervention by the Eastern Cape Provincial Executive in terms of Section 139(5) (a) of the Constitution in 2018. However, after the municipality failed to make progress in improving its financial and service delivery performance, Cabinet decided to place it under a national intervention.5.4.  The invocation of a national intervention in terms of Section 139(7) of the Constitution implies that in both municipalities, national government will now act in the stead of the Provincial Executive. This type of intervention is mandatory and follows the same procedure as Section 139(5) of the Constitution, except that national government will now directly assume responsibility for these interventions. 5.5.  To give effect to the assumption of responsibility, National Cabinet Representatives (NCR) will shortly be deployed to both municipalities. The Minister of Finance will delegate powers to the NCR and will also be supported by a multidisciplinary team of experts. No decision has yet been taken to dissolve the municipal council in terms of Section 139(5)(b) of the Constitution.5.6.  The national intervention will take effect upon formal gazetting in the Government Gazette, however, the current Section 139(5) intervention will remain in effect until this date. The Section 139(1) intervention into the Enoch Mgijima Local Municipality will also be replaced by a Section 139 (5) (a) and (c) intervention, which will also cover the failure of the municipality to fulfil its executive obligations. The Minister in The Presidency, Mr Mondli  Gungubele will   together with the Minister of Finance, Mr  Enoch Godongwana and the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs,  Dr  Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma   hold a media briefieng next week to outline the national intervention.C.

The process to rebuild affected areas has already started as the people of our country unite in their determination to assist those who have lost their homes and possessions.2. Update on the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) 2.1. Cabinet noted with concern the recent spike in COVID-19 infections in some parts of the country and urged all people to take precautionary measures to protect themselves against the deadly virus, especially during winter.2.2. The virus is still a constant threat and vaccination remains the most effective weapon to protect ourselves. The cabinet is pleased that more people continue to choose vaccination as their first line of defence against COVID-19 after recent statistics showed that we have reached the milestone of over 50 per cent of adult vaccinations in five provinces.   2.3. Cabinet calls on those who have not yet been vaccinated to do so to protect themselves and their loved ones. We should also all continue to adhere to all COVID-19 prevention protocols, including the wearing of a mask that covers both the nose and mouth, washing hands with water and soap, or using a 70% alcohol-based hand sanitiser, and keeping a safe social distance of at least one metre. 3.  Social Relief of Distress (SRD) Grant 3.1. Cabinet encouraged citizens receiving the R350 SRD Grant to reapply, following the introduction of new regulations governing applications and eligibility for the grant.3.2. Applications can be lodged on the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA)  website: https://srd.sassa.gov.za/. The application system opened on 23 April 2022 and is a fully digital process to enable quick turnaround times. 3.3.

These senseless murders are a reminder that we must do more as a society to end violence and gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF). 4.2.

Together we can ensure that our communities and streets are safer for all people, including the elderly, women and children. 5. Economy5.1. Cabinet welcomed the official opening of Corobrik s Kwastina brick manufacturing factory at Driefontein in Gauteng by President Ramaphosa on Wednesday, 4 May 2022. The state-of-the-art factory forms part of an R800 million investment, which goes hand in hand with a further R200 million earmarked to expand Corobrik s concrete operations in KwaZulu-Natal. Corobrik is one of several local businesses that have responded to President Ramaphosa s call on South African and international enterprises to invest in this economy.5.2. Cabinet noted that the fledgling hydrogen economy has been given a boost with the launch of a hydrogen-powered truck by Anglo American. The truck   which was converted from diesel to hydrogen, and is powered in part by lithium-ion batteries   is a world first. The hydrogen economy has been identified as a strategic priority for our country s green economy, and to drive economic growth and employment. 5.3. Cabinet also welcomed a further investment into our economy by an Irish food company, The Kerry Group, which has opened a new R650-million plant in Hammarsdale, KwaZulu-Natal aimed at producing sustainable food for the continent. The plant is unique as it boasts numerous sustainability features including low energy usage equipment, solar power generation to reduce consumption from the local grid, waste heat capture, and efficient water capture, reuse and reduction. The Kerry Group has had a presence in South Africa since 2011, and their further investment is a sign that South Africa remains an investment destination of choice.5.4. These investments follow in the footsteps of the launch of the locally manufactured Isuzu D-Max bakkie in Gqeberha in the Eastern Cape last month. The new generation D-MAX crowns Isuzu s commitment to South Africa and is one of the successes achieved under the Automotive Production Development Programme (APDP). The APDP is a production incentive scheme for the motor industry aimed at promoting production volumes in the specified motor vehicle industry, promoting added value in the automotive component industry thus creating employment across the automotive value chain. Approximately R2,8 billion will be generated in local content production value through the lifecycle of the APDP. The investment will secure more than 1 000 direct jobs at the plant and indirectly employ 24 000 people, contributing significantly to community upliftment in the region. 6. Mining Indaba6.1.

Cabinet is confident that the Mining Indaba will assist in showcasing and promoting South Africa as an investment destination of choice.6.3.

Cabinet Decisions1. Budget Votes1.1. Cabinet calls on all citizens to follow the various Budget Votes by national government departments and The Presidency so that they can hold the government to account. 1.2. During Budget Votes, all departments give a detailed account of their plans and priorities for the year.

Issues in the environment1.  Recovery and rebuilding efforts after the floods 1.1.  Cabinet expressed its praise and appreciation to all people and organisations involved in recovery and rebuilding efforts following the recent devastating floods in some parts of the country, especially in KwaZulu-Natal. It thanked all non-governmental organisations, faith-based organisations, communities, business people and relief organisations that have provided food, clothes, blankets, dignity packs and school uniforms to vulnerable families to meet their basic needs. 1.2.  The National Disaster Management Centre continues to coordinate all spheres of government in its efforts to provide humanitarian relief to all affected households. Sheltering services are being provided to over 7 000 people in the four worst affected districts in KwaZulu-Natal. 1.3.  Work has started on building temporary residences for affected families on state-owned land parcels that have been identified in KwaZulu-Natal for possible resettlement. Cabinet affirmed government s commitment to managing the flood relief funds prudently and transparently. The Auditor-General of South Africa is providing an additional monitoring service and the reprioritisation of funds is in line with the government s budgeting system. 2.  Update on the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) 2.1.  Cabinet urged all people in South Africa to take precautionary measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 after latest statistics showed a marked increase in the rate of infections and illnesses associated with the winter season in the country. 2.2.  Cabinet reminded everyone to continue safeguarding ourselves and other people by washing or sanitising our hands regularly, wearing a mask when indoors, maintaining a safe social distance, opening windows for ventilation and vaccinating.2.3.  Vaccination remains the best defence against COVID-19 as it prevents severe illness, hospitalisation and even death. You do not need a home address to vaccinate. Any person, with or without an identity document, can get vaccinated for free at all public vaccination sites across the country.3.  Stop racism!3.1.  Cabinet strongly condemned all acts of racism in the country, including the reported incidents at the Good Hope Seminary High School and the University of Stellenbosch in the Western Cape. These deplorable acts go against the constitutional values on which our democratic country was founded, which include human dignity, non-racialism, non-sexism, social justice, equity and respect. 3.2.  The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996 is our guide towards eradicating the despicable divisions and injustices of the past. Parents are urged to teach children to reject racism and embrace diversity, as part of our concerted drive to promote nation-building and social cohesion.3.3.  Let us work together to expose racism wherever it is treated as the norm and send a clear message that there is no space for it in our democratic country. 4.  South Africa   Germany relations4.1.

They also reflected on developments on the African continent and internationally, including the conflict in Ukraine and its impact on the international economy and food and energy security. 4.4.

Child labour represents the worst of society and exposes children to dangerous situations. It constitutes abuse and prevents children from getting an education and other developmental opportunities. Every child in South Africa has the inalienable right to be protected from exploitative labour practices.  5.4.  The right to basic education is enshrined in our Constitution and in terms of the South African Schools Act, 1996 (Act 84 of 1996),  every parent must cause every learner for whom he or she is responsible to attend a school from the first school day of the year in which such learner reaches the age of seven years until the last school day of the year in which such learner reaches the age of 15 years or the ninth grade, whichever occurs first . 5.5.  In terms of the Children s Act, 2005 (Act 38 of 2005),  no person may use, procure, offer or employ a child for child labour .B.  Cabinet decisions1.  Accession to the International Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance (ICPPED)  1.1.  Cabinet approved the submission of the ICPPED to Parliament for consideration of South Africa acceding to the convention.

Once acceded to be domesticated into our laws, South Africa will be expected to report every two years to the UN on how it is giving effect to the convention. The convention provides preventative measures the member countries need to put in place to prevent the enforced disappearance of persons in their respective countries. 2.  South Africa s fourth Country Report on the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights 2.1.  Cabinet approved the submission of the fourth Country Report on the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights to the United Nations Human Rights Council.

Cabinet endorsed the NMYD to take place annually starting in 2022. The inaugural NMYD will take place from 7 to 20 July 2022.

The dialogues   which will be anchored on our international icon former President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela   will start conversations to inculcate the culture of an ethical leadership in Africa.5.3.  They will afford young people an opportunity to share their rich cultural heritage. The initiative will also strengthen people-to-people relations amongst the youth of the continent. The Department of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities will provide details of the programme for the events at a later stage.6.  2021/22 Annual Performance Monitoring Report on Women Empowerment and Gender Equality, Youth Development and Promotion of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities6.1.

The report tracks the key indicators in the promotion of equity, level of employment and the ownership and participation of these groups in the activities of the departments and the state-owned entities.6.2.

The Bill amends the current Mine Health and Safety Act, 1996 (Act 29 of 1996).1.2.  The revised amendments provide, among others, clarity on some of the concepts in the Act, strengthen the health and safety regulatory framework and align it with international best practices with regard to safety in the mines. 2.  The Constitution Eighteenth Amendment Bill of 2022  2.1.  Cabinet approved the publication of the Constitution Eighteenth Amendment Bill of 2022 for public comments and that the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, Mr Ronald Lamola, can give notice with particulars of the proposed amendment to the Constitution. 2.2.

Statement on the Cabinet Meeting of 8 June 2022,9 Jun 2022,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-08-june-2022-9-jun-2022-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-cabinet-meeting-08-june-2022-9-jun-2022-0000,"A.  Issues in the Environment1.  Economy  1.1.  Cabinet has welcomed the recent positive developments in the country s interventions aimed at stimulating economic growth. According to the recent unemployment figures from Statistics South Africa, unemployment decreased from 35.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2021 to 34.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2022. The expanded unemployment rate has declined for a second quarter in a row. The biggest job gains were in community and social services, manufacturing and trade. 1.2.  The gross domestic product in the first quarter of 2022 grew by 1.9% which takes the size of our economy to pre-pandemic levels. Over the quarter, the manufacturing sector was the economy s key performer with an increase in the production of petroleum and chemicals, food and beverages, and metals and machinery.1.3.  These moderate gains show that our economy remains robust and that interventions such as the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan are gaining momentum. Cabinet calls on everyone to support local businesses and industries by buying local products and services.  1.4.  Cabinet also welcomed the decision by the rating agency S&P Global to revise South Africa's credit rating outlook   from stable to positive. Rating agency also affirmed the long-term foreign and local currency debt ratings at BB minus and BB respectively.  2.  Cost of living   2.1.  The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the ongoing global conflict have had a severe impact on the cost of living worldwide. South Africans too are frustrated by rising prices of fuel, food and essentials. 2.2.  We all need to pull together, help each other and save our resources in this difficult time. Government is doing everything in its power to provide relief for everyone, especially the poor.2.3.  Our well-functioning, strong and independent South African Reserve Bank is helping to shield society from the ravages of inflation by keeping it within a narrow target range; well below what many other countries are currently experiencing.2.4.  Cabinet welcomed the decision by National Treasury to grant an extension of the reduction in the General Fuel Levy (GFL). The GFL was cut by R1.50 a litre for April and May, and will be further extended from 1 June to 6 July 2022.  2.5.  Cabinet also welcomed the decision of the Competition Commission to closely monitor prices of essential food items, particularly the provision that businesses should justify their price increases.3.  Japan-South Africa Business Forum3.1.  Cabinet welcomed the outcomes of the recent Japan-South Africa Business Forum, which agreed to an ambitious work programme that includes collaboration on green industrialisation, electric vehicle technologies and green hydrogen. 3.2.  The forum also agreed to a virtual  roadshow  to highlight South African opportunities to more Japanese businesses, skills development in the local auto industry, work streams on manufacturing opportunities and the exchange of technical experiences.3.3.  Japan is one of our most important trade partners and a leading investor in a number of South African sectors, ranging from automobiles to advanced mining machinery, and from agribusiness to financial services.3.4.  Cabinet also welcomed the establishment of the Black Exporters Network by the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition (the dtic), to bring together black-owned firms which are currently exporting locally made goods to other parts of the world. The network will enable the sharing of information, experience and know-how, and it builds on the successes of the Black industrialist Programme. 4.  Energy 4.1.  Our long-term energy security has been given a massive boost following the commercial handover of Unit 4 at the Kusile Power Station in Mpumalanga. This handover marks another milestone in Eskom s efforts to stabilise the power system and will add 800 megawatts (MW) to the power grid. 4.2.  Cabinet noted that the construction of four out of the six generation units had been completed at the Kusile Power Station project. 4.3.  Cabinet welcomed the addition of new generation capacity to the grid, which was made possible by the decision to allow independent power producers to produce electricity. Government recently signed an agreement to buy 150 MW of capacity from a renewable power producer, Scatec ASA.5.  Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) Advisory Council5.1.  Cabinet welcomed the appointment by President Cyril Ramaphosa of the country s new B-BBEE Advisory Council.5.2.  The council comprises a diverse group of people from business, trade unions, community-based organisations and academia, who will be responsible for guiding government on the transformation of the economy.5.3.  While there has been remarkable progress in reversing apartheid s distortions on the economy, more work still needs to be done in increasing black management control, upscaling skills development and broadening procurement to give opportunities to black women and the youth.6.  Floods 6.1.  Ongoing government relief efforts in the provinces affected by the recent devastating floods are making a significant impact. Government has prioritised the provision of food, water and shelter for displaced people and the repair of damaged infrastructure. Extensive work is underway to restore basic services such as water, electricity, sanitation and waste removal.6.2.  About R189, 217 million is being used for the Upgrading of the Informal Settlements Programme aimed at improving the quality of life of informal settlement dwellers.  6.3.  An additional R733, 086 million has been allocated through the Human Settlements Development Grant to assist in the creation of sustainable and integrated human settlements. 6.4.  Cabinet welcomed the humanitarian aid from the State of Qatar in the form of foodstuff, clothing, generators, water purifiers, ventilators, tents and medical supplies. The donation will benefit over 4 000 citizens temporarily housed in community care centres. Cabinet also welcomed the humanitarian aid from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the form of foodstuff and water to assist victims of the recent floods.7.  Launch of Social Development Fund7.1  Cabinet welcomed the launch of the Social Employment Fund by the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) in partnership with the Presidency and the dtic. The support will provide bridging employment opportunities for up to 50 000 young persons in socially-useful work being done in local communities. 7.2  The support will include  health and community care, food and nutrition support like soup kitchens, promotion of literacy, greening and climate change mitigation programmes as well as  and youth support initiatives.  The Fund will support 26 community and not-for-profit enterprises.8.  Crime and corruption 8.1.  Cabinet welcomed the arrest of several individuals in connection with fraud, money laundering and corruption. These include former high ranking state and parastatal employees, some of whom face charges relating to the contravention of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act 1 of 1999). The arrests   which include that of a Home Affairs official at the Desmond Tutu Refugee Reception Centre in Pretoria who allegedly accepted a bribe from a foreign national   bear testimony to the fact that no one is above the law and that there is no space for dishonest employees in the public sector. 8.2.  Cabinet also welcomed the progress being made on the extradition of the Gupta brothers, Rajesh and Atul, back to South Africa. This follows their recent arrest at Dubai in the UAE after the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) had issued red notices. The brothers are wanted in South Africa in connection with their alleged role in state capture, including fraud and money laundering. Discussions between law-enforcement agencies in the UAE and South Africa on their extradition are underway. Their arrest demonstrates government s determination to fight crime and corruption without fear or favour. 8.3.  These arrests demonstrate that processes and mechanisms are working effectively to hold perpetrators accountable for their heinous actions and ensure that no one is above the law. 8.4.  Cabinet condemned the blatant attempt to undermine our economy and country following the malicious damage to a cable at Unit 1 of Eskom's Matla Power Station in Mpumalanga. This was the fourth incident of suspected sabotage at a power station after similar incidents were reported at three other power stations in the past few weeks.8.5.  The recent crime statistics are a reflection that we must do more as a society to make our communities safer. This reality reminds us that reducing crime is a societal responsibility and that all of us   including the police, political leaders, communities, families, business people, workers and civil society   should play our part in fighting crime. 8.6.  Cabinet is confident that the additional funds that have been prioritised by the Ministry of Police for the police stations with a high number of murders, rapes and other violent crime will help turn the tide and create safer communities for all.9.  Update on COVID-199.1.  Cabinet reminded everyone that COVID-19 has not been eradicated and the risks of new infections will increase during the winter season. We must continue to take all the necessary precautions to safeguard ourselves and other people. They include washing or sanitising hands regularly, wearing a mask when indoors, keeping a safe social distance, opening windows for ventilation and vaccinating.10.  African Union (AU) Summit10.1.  Cabinet welcomed the declaration, pledges and commitments adopted at the AU s Extraordinary Summit on Terrorism and Unconstitutional Changes in Africa held in Malabo, Republic of Equatorial Guinea, on Saturday, 28 May 2022.10.2.  African leaders assessed the persistent threats, evaluated current response mechanisms and committed to strengthening the collective security of member states facing terrorism and violent extremism.11.  Monkeypox disease11.1.  Cabinet assured South Africans that our health authorities are on high alert to monitor and prevent Monkeypox disease, following its outbreak in several non-endemic countries. Although no positive case has so far been detected or reported in South Africa, health authorities in the country continue to monitor the situation very closely.B.  Cabinet Decision1.  Public consultation on measures to deal with illegal trading on scrap metal 1.1.  Cabinet approved that public consultations be undertaken on proposals to restrict the trade of illegally obtained scrap and processed metals. The theft of scrap metal and copper cable from public infrastructure hinders the performance of the economy by imposing enormous costs.1.2.  Some of the disruptions include the supply of energy and rail services due to vandalised rail tracks. They impose additional transport costs on commuters due to disrupted commuter transport. Vandalised and unsecured electricity cables pose a safety risks to communities, especially children. 1.3.  Cabinet directed that the dtic should lead the consultations within a limited period, and solicit inputs from the public and relevant sectors on effective measures that government can implement to stop the vandalising of critical economic infrastructures. Thereafter, Cabinet will pronounce on the approved measures. C.  Upcoming events1.  United Nations (UN) Partnership for Technology in Peacekeeping International Symposium (PTPS) 1.1.  South Africa will host the 6th PTPS at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Pretoria from Tuesday, 21 to Friday, 24 June 2022.  It is expected to be attended by 300 delegates from 50 member states.1.2.  The symposium brings together all interested military, police, and civilians from  the UN Member States to collaborate in the use of modern, advanced technologies and concepts in UN-led field missions. The symposium will be used as an information-sharing and brainstorming platform for UN member states involved in peacekeeping initiatives on the usage of the latest technologies in  peacekeeping missions. 2.  4th WorldSkills South Africa (WSZA) Biennial National Competition 2.1.  The 4th WSZA Biennial National Competition is being held at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre in KwaZulu-Natal from 7 to 10 June 2022 under the theme:  Ratcheting up the Production of 21st Century Artisans . 2.2.  The event is used to promote artisan skills as a viable career choice as well as to open up potential partnerships with the industry. It is also used to assess the levels of our apprenticeships and artisan development in addition to advocating for the uptake of artisan careers as careers of the first choice by our students.  D.

Statement on the Cabinet Meeting of 22 June 2022,23 Jun 2022,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-virtual-cabinet-meeting-wednesday-22-june-2022-23-jun-2022-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-virtual-cabinet-meeting-wednesday-22-june-2022-23-jun-2022-0000,"A.    ISSUES IN THE ENVIRONMENT1.    Climate Change1.1.    Cabinet welcomed the visit to South Africa by Mr Alok Sharma, President of the 26th United Nations (UN) Climate Change Summit, from 19 to 21 June 2022, and his assessment that South Africa has shown a clear commitment to a clean energy transition.1.2.    In 2021, President Cyril Ramaphosa joined other leaders in announcing a historic partnership with the governments of France, Germany, United Kingdom and United States, as well as the European Union, to support a just transition to a low carbon economy and a climate resilient society.1.3.    South Africa has been hard at work in preparing the ground for our clean energy transition and a move to clean energy sources such as green hydrogen, biomass, wind power, solar power and hydro-power, among other renewables. This so-called energy mix allows for a balance between energy sources to ensure reliable power to meet the country s growing energy needs.2.    Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) vaccine uptake2.1.    Cabinet welcomed the significant drop in COVID-19 infections recorded in South Africa over the past few weeks and encouraged all eligible people to  continue  to vaccinate, which helps to prevent serious illness, hospitalisation and death.2.2.    Half of all adult South Africans have to date received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. Government aims to use the low-interest loan recently approved by the World Bank to purchase additional COVID-19 vaccine doses and ensure that the nation is adequately protected against potential infections.2.3.    Cabinet also considered matters related to developments on the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly with the progress being made towards a full return to normal socio-economic activities. The Minister of Health, Dr Joe Phaahla, will provide further details.3.    National Youth Day   3.1.    Cabinet thanked all South Africans for joining in the country s National Youth Day commemorations on Thursday, 16 June 2022 under the theme:  Promoting sustainable livelihood and resilience of young people for a better tomorrow.  The spirit of enthusiasm and resilience shown by the youth across our nation is indeed a cause for celebration and hope for a better tomorrow.3.2.    As National Youth Month draws to an end, let us intensify our efforts to ensure young people access the many support programmes provided by government and facilitate their active participation in the economy.3.3.    The Public Service, as the largest employer, has responded to this challenge by enabling unemployed graduates to gain experience through the Public Service Graduate Internship and Learnership Programme. Government is also implementing the Social Employment Fund (SEF) and revitalised National Youth Service (NYS) job-creation initiatives that will each draw 50 000 young people into the economy.3.4.    These initiatives will not only provide much-needed work experience but will also reinforce the value of active citizenship. The SEF partners with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) while the NYS enlists young people for services which benefit communities across the country. 4.    Transport  4.1.    Cabinet welcomed the 11-point Action Plan to deal with road blockages and recruitment of foreign nationals as truck drivers. The plan, which was developed by the Road and Freight Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) in partnership with the road and freight industry stakeholders, promotes amongst others the enforcement of visa requirements and compliance with labour laws.4.2.    The IMC was formed to deal with escalating road blockages and protests by disgruntled South African truck drivers. Protests and road blockages adversely impact mobility, scare foreign investors and most importantly, negatively impact the economy and essential supply chains which use affected corridors.5.    Nelson Mandela Bay (NMB) Metropolitan Municipality water shortages5.1.    Cabinet welcomed the intervention of the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) in the NMB Metropolitan Municipality in the Eastern Cape to avert Day Zero as the province is facing severe water shortages which started in 2015. The DWS is working with the province to implement short, medium and long-term measures to address and mitigate the potential impact of the drought.5.2.    Cabinet further urged the residents of NMB to adhere to water restrictions imposed by local municipalities to ensure water security. Overall, water use must be reduced by 50 million litres per day, from the current level of 280 million litres per day down to 230 million litres per day.6.    Crime and corruption   6.1.    Cabinet welcomed the recent arrest of a Home Affairs official stationed at the Benoni office for issuing a fraudulent passport to a Bangladeshi national. The official, Ms Sibongile Simelane, was granted R5 000 bail in the Benoni Magistrate's Court on Tuesday, 21 June 2022. The Bangladeshi national, Mr Fahim Kazi, was arrested while trying to leave the country on 12 May 2022 under the name,  Lebogang Ndlovu .6.2.    The Department of Home Affairs (DHA) recently deported Lithuanian actress, Ms Ieva Andrejevaite, who sought to abuse South Africa s refugee management regime when she fabricated a story of wanting to apply for asylum because of the  war in Ukraine .6.3.    Cabinet commends the work being done by the DHA s Counter Corruption Unit. It applauds and encourages ordinary South Africans to continue to report such criminal acts. The unlawful acts of South Africans who sell their identities have far-reaching negative implications for the country s security and socio-economic status.6.4.    Government will continue to deal harshly against anyone involved in illegal acts that undermine our immigration laws, without fear or favour.6.5.    Cabinet  also welcomed the recent conviction and sentencing of a Durban teacher, Ms Nomusa Precious Gabuza (37)   who was sentenced to three years' correctional supervision and four years' imprisonment, wholly suspended for three years, in the Umlazi Regional Court in KwaZulu-Natal   for contravening the Local Government Municipal Electoral Act, 2000 (Act 27 of 2000). As a teacher at the school which was used as a voting station during the Municipal Elections in October 2021, Ms Gabuza pleaded guilty for fraudulently casting 24 votes, including 12 for the Municipal Elections and 12 for the Ward Elections.6.6.    The conviction and sentencing underscore the Electoral Commission of South Africa s commitment to intervene timeously and apply consequence management. This is also a strong affirmation of the electoral systems, which have since been strengthened with the introduction of the Voter Management Device that prevents double voting.6.7.    Cabinet affirmed that elections are the cornerstone of our democracy and must be protected at all costs. 7.    World Trade Organisation (WTO) 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12)7.1.    Cabinet welcomed the outcomes of the WTO MC12 held in Geneva, Switzerland from 12 to 17 June 2022, in particular the decision that eligible countries could override COVID-19 vaccine patents until 2027. The decision on whether to extend this to COVID-19 therapeutics and diagnostics was delayed for six months.7.2.    South Africa had been leading the call for the WTO to waiver intellectual property rights tied to COVID-19 vaccines that will ensure equal access to vaccines and enable countries that have the capability to manufacture vaccines to do so.7.3.    The conference also committed to an open and inclusive process to reform all its functions and agreed to a package of trade deals addressing areas such as health, setting limits on fishing subsidies, a moratorium on e-commerce trade and food security.B.    CABINET DECISIONS 1.    Progress on Broadcasting Digital Migration (BDM) Programme1.1.    Cabinet received an update on the BDM Programme and noted the progress made with the installation of set-top boxes as part of migrating from analogue to digital broadcasting.1.2.    Cabinet re-emphasised the urgency for concluding the BDM to free up the spectrum needed for mobile broadband, and other information and communications technology related purposes.1.3.    Communications and Digital Technologies Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni will hold a media briefing tomorrow (Friday, 24 June) to provide more details.2.

The report provides an update on the implementation of the National Plan of Action for the Children for the 2019-2024 period. 2.2.    The report highlights the achievements recorded for the 2020-2021 period. It also highlights areas that remain a challenge, including the safety of children and the continued disparities between the poor and the rich in respect of children. The report also reflects on how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted on children during this period.2.3.    The intervention measures being implemented by government are aimed at realising the rights of children, as outlined in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996. They also support the country s obligations to the UN Conventions on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (ACRWC). South Africa is a signatory to both the UNCRC and ACRWC.2.4.    The report was compiled in consultation with government departments and a number of relevant stakeholders at national and provincial levels. The full report will be posted on the Department of Social Development website: www.dsd.gov.za.3.    South Africa s Combined third to sixth Periodic Report to the UNCRC3.1.    Cabinet approved the tabling of the third to the sixth Periodic Report to the UNCRC. This report follows the second Periodic Report that was tabled to the UNCRC in 2014.3.2.    The report has been compiled in accordance with Article 44 of the UNCRC, and also covers the observations and recommendations made from the last report. The UNCRC sent its observations and recommendations for the country in 2016.3.3.    The compilation was done in consultation with all relevant departments and stakeholders across the country. The full report will be made public once it has been tabled to the UNCRC.4.    National report on implementing the New Urban Agenda4.1.    Cabinet approved the submission of South Africa s first national report on the Implementation of the New Urban Agenda to the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat). The UN-Habitat adopted its New Urban Agenda at its Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development in October 2016. Member states were expected to submit progress reports voluntarily.4.2.    South Africa supported the adoption of the New Urban Agenda and subsequently implemented it through the country s Integrated Urban Development Framework (IUDF). The IUDF aims to guide the development of inclusive, resilient and liveable urban settlements.4.3.    The progress report was compiled in consultation with national, provincial and local spheres of government, and relevant NGOs.5.    Integrated Youth Development Strategy (IYDS)5.1.    Cabinet approved the IYDS for implementation. The strategy gives effect to the National Youth Policy 2020-2030. It outlines the actions, projects and programmes to be undertaken by various stakeholders from youth formations.5.2.    It also deals with minimising the duplication of government interventions and guides how civil society and the private sector can support young people from accessing opportunities. The compilation of the strategy involved diverse inputs from various sectors of society.6.    Draft White Paper on Conservation and Sustainable Use of South Africa s Biodiversity6.1.    Cabinet approved the draft White Paper on Conservation and Sustainable Use of South Africa s Biodiversity for public comments. South Africa's biodiversity provides an important basis for economic growth and development, and is critical to people s livelihoods. 6.2.    This White Paper gives effect to the recommendations made by the High-Level Panel of Experts appointed in 2019 to review our current policies, legislation and practices on matters relating to iconic species.6.3.    The report recommended the development of an overarching policy on conservation and sustainable use of the country s biodiversity. The policy will be implemented across all spheres of government. Conservation is important for the country s drive to accelerate economic growth and job creation.7.    Game Meat Strategy 7.1.    Cabinet approved the publication of the draft Game Meat Strategy for public comments. The strategy seeks to formalise and transform the game meat industry. It also seeks to contribute towards food security in a sustainable manner.7.2.    The game meat industry is predominately an informal industry that operates in a fragmented manner. The proposed strategy provides an implementation plan that will formalise and strengthen the sector as both a provider of food security and an economic growth sector that can help create job opportunities.C.    BILLS 1.    Traditional Affairs General Amendment Bill of 20221.1.    Cabinet approved the submission of the Traditional Affairs General Amendment Bill of 2022 to Parliament for further processing. The amendments seek to revise the Traditional and Khoi-San Leadership Act, 2019 (Act 3 of 2019), which came into effect on 1 April 2021.2.    Protection of Constitutional Democracy Against Terrorist and Related Activities Amendment Bill of 20222.1.

Once adopted, the Bill will amend the current Protection of Constitutional Democracy Against Terrorist and Related Activities Act, 2004 (Act 33 of 2004).2.2.    The Bill went through an extensive public consultation process after it was approved by Cabinet in May 2021. The amendments seek to align the country s domestic instruments of fighting terrorism with the global measures that have been put in place. They have also addressed the clauses that were deemed unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court.2.3.    As a signatory to the UN Security Council, South Africa is duty-bound to domesticate the international laws that seek to strengthen measures to combat global terrorism. D.    UPCOMING EVENTS 1.    14th Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) Summit1.1.    President Ramaphosa will lead South Africa s participation in the virtual 14th BRICS Leaders  Summit hosted by the People s Republic of China from Thursday, 23 to Friday, 24 June 2022. 1.2.    Our BRICS membership   continues to benefit the country. Last year over 17 percent of South Africa s exports were destined to other BRICS countries, and over 29 percent of our total imports came from these countries. The value of this trade continues to grow, with total South African trade with other BRICS countries reaching R702 billion in 2021, up from R487 billion in 2017. 1.3.    Collaboration within BRICS members in various areas such as health and enhanced trade has grown our local industry, and benefited all BRICS members. Our investment in infrastructure development projects and efforts to reduce red tape when doing business aim to increase exports to our BRICS partners.2.    Economic Governance Winter School2.1.    The National School of Government (NSG) will host its third Economic Governance Winter School Programme for Political Executives in Johannesburg from 27 June to 1 July 2022.

The NSG designed the annual programme for members of the executive in 2020, as part of its support to government s commitment to build a capable state. It seeks to, among other things, equip executives within the three spheres of government with enhanced leadership and oversight capabilities to be able to re-examine governance challenges that constrain inclusivity and sustainable economic growth.3.    Nelson Mandela International Day 3.1.    This year s Nelson Mandela International Day on Monday, 18 July 2022  will be celebrated under the global theme:  Do what you can, with what you have, wherever you are .3.2.    It is a clarion call for people to support and participate in the campaign by contributing sustainable interventions with a lasting impact.3.3.    One such sustainable intervention is the annual Nelson Mandela Youth Dialogue and Ethical Leadership Programme focusing on topical issues concerning young people in South Africa and across the globe.4.    Tax Season 4.1.    The 2022 tax filing season will open from 1 July to 24 October 2022. Taxpayers are encouraged to file their returns on eFiling (www.sarsefiling.co.za) or on the South African Revenue Service (SARS) MobiApp. 4.2.    This year SARS will continue with the auto-assessment of individual taxpayers, which is a pre-populated income tax return to help simplify the submission process. In 2021 more than three million taxpayers were auto-assessed.4.3.    The timely and accurate submission of tax returns not only ensures taxpayers remain compliant, but it also helps government to deliver services to South Africans who need them most.E.

Statement on the virtual Cabinet Meeting of 7 July 2022,11 Jul 2022,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-virtual-cabinet-meeting-held-thursday-7-july-2022-11-jul-2022-0000,https://www.gov.za/speeches/statement-virtual-cabinet-meeting-held-thursday-7-july-2022-11-jul-2022-0000,"A. Issues in the Environment1. Update on the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)1.1. Cabinet commended all people in South Africa who chose to vaccinate and observe all COVID-19 protocols that resulted in the country averting rising numbers of new cases during the fifth wave of the pandemic. 1.2. However, we must not be complacent as COVID-19 is still in our midst. Although the country recently scrapped the compulsory wearing of masks in public, people with comorbidities and those who are ill are encouraged to continue wearing a mask. We must also continue to wash or sanitise our hands, and observe social distancing and proper ventilation.  1.3. Vaccination remains the scientifically proven defence against COVID-19 and Cabinet encourages all unvaccinated people to vaccinate without delay and vaccinated people to get their booster shots at their nearest vaccination sites, for free. 2. Monkeypox2.1. Cabinet was updated on the latest developments in the spread of Monkeypox disease in the country following the recent confirmation of a second case in the country. The affected persons are isolating at home and contact tracing is being conducted to detect others who may have been exposed. 2.2. The Department of Health and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases are collaborating with the World Health Organisation to assess the risk for local transmission in line with the International Health Regulations. 2.3. The monkeypox virus is not easily spread and usually only occurs after close contact such as kissing, cuddling or touching parts of the body with monkeypox lesions. People without monkeypox symptoms cannot spread the virus to others. 2.4. Cabinet advised people who experience symptoms of fever, general flu-like signs, followed by a blister-like rash to report to their nearest healthcare facility for early detection and treatment. 3. East London tavern tragedy3.1. The devastating tragedy at the Enyobeni Tavern in East London in the Eastern Cape on Sunday, 26 June 2022 that claimed the lives of 21 teenagers, has shattered our entire country. It is hard to imagine the anguish of families who lost their children in such a tragic manner. 3.2. Cabinet expressed its condolences to the families who lost their loved ones and thanked everyone for their humanitarian support to the grieving families during this difficult time. 3.3. It is concerning that children as young as 13 were allowed to enter the venue and consume alcohol. We call on communities to play their part in keeping our children safe at all times. 3.4. Children under the age of 18 are not allowed to enter taverns, shebeens, pubs and bottle stores.

The B-BBEE Act of 2013 provides for the Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition to issue codes of good practice on black economic empowerment in the specific sectors.

Further announcements will be made following the conclusion of the intensive deliberations of these reports.1.3. Cabinet expressed regret at the disruption and inconvenience caused by load-shedding to businesses and households, particularly happening at the time when government is engaged with the interventions announced by the President in July 2022. 2. Investment 2.1. Cabinet welcomed the launch of the new Sandvik Khomanani Manufacturing Site in Kempton Park, which was part of the R350-million investment pledged at the fourth South Africa Investment Conference (SAIC) held at the Sandton Convention Centre in Johannesburg on 24 March 2022.2.2. The new 62 000 square-metre facility consolidates operations previously undertaken at five separate sites and accommodates about 550 employees.

Cabinet further welcomed the oversight visit by President Ramaphosa in KwaZulu-Natal during the launch of the Hesto Harnesses manufacturing facility in Stanger, KwaDukuza on 13 September 2022. This facility is one of five capital investment projects that form part of a R1.4-billion commitment by Metair Investments Limited to support the expansion and localisation of the new Ford Ranger.2.4. The President also attended the opening of the Sappi Saiccor Mill upgrade and expansion project worth R7,7 billion in Umkomaas, which is aimed at increasing the capacity and global competitiveness of the company while also creating short- and long-term employment opportunities. 2.5.

Factors which influenced this decrease included load-shedding, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the high cost of living and inflation.5.2. The interventions made by the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan (ERRP) have largely cushioned the country from the international headwinds, and also protected jobs and livelihoods.
