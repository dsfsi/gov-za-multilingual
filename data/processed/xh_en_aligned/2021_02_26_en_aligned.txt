4th Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) The 4th QLFS released by Statistics South Africa on Tuesday, 23 February 2021 continues to remind us of the challenges of unemployment facing the countr
Cabinet is however encouraged by the green shoots that our economy continues to demonstrate amongst the current harsh economic realitie According to the recent statistics employment increased by 333 000 jobs, with the formal sector contributing the largest (189 000 jobs) between Quarter 3 and Quarter 4 in 2020.
Cabinet remains concerned that the rate at which the economy creates jobs remains slower than the rate the country sheds jobs by 701 000 between Quarter 3 and Quarter 4.
