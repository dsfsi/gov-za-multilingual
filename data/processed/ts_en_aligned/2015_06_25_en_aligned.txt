Irrelevance of official capacity1.
This Statute shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacit In particular, official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence

Article 98(2) is significant and unambiguou It clearly states that the ICC may not request the surrender of a person by the requested State, if that would result in the requested state breaching its international obligations, unless the ICC itself can first obtain the cooperation of the sending Stat In other words, the Article 98(2) places an obligation on the ICC to assist countries to execute warrants of arresIt is abundantly clear that the ICC was aware that South Africa may have difficulties in executing the warrant of arrest for President Al-Bashir, because of its international obligationThe ICC had on 28 May 2015, already, invited South Africa to hold consultations with it regarding the execution of the warrant of arrest in accordance with Article 97 which provides in clear and unequivocal terms that where a State Party receives a request in relation to which it identifies problems which may impede or prevent the execution of the request, that State shall consult with the Court without delay in order to resolve the matteSuch problems may include the fact that execution of the request in its current form would require the requested State to breach a pre-existing treaty obligation undertaken with respect to another StatThe ICC must have been aware that South Africa would, in the execution of the warrant, breach its existing treaty obligations with the A That must be the only plausible reason why the ICC had invited South Africa to consult with iHaving extended an invitation to South Africa to consult with it, the ICC had a duty to consult in good faith with South Africa and to assist it to comply with its obligations to the ICC and the ASouth Africa accepted the invitation by the ICC to consult with it in terms of Article 97.
