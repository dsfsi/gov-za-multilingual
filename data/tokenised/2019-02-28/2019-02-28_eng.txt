Issues In The Environment.
2019 Budget Speech.
Cabinet welcomes the 2019 Budget Speech delivered by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni in Parliament, Cape Town on Wednesday, 20 February 2019, as a framework that has set South Africa on a path where together we are enabled to renew and rebuild our economy into an inclusive and thriving one.
The Budget Speech brings into effect the commitments outlined by President Cyril Ramaphosa in his State of the Nation Address in Parliament, Cape Town on 7 February 2019.
Cabinet supports various initiatives, including cutting the public sector wage bill, in order to generate additional savings to strengthen government’s finances.
Imposing strict conditions of financial support to Eskom to help the utility restructure into a viable organisation is also welcomed.
We all have a part to play in growing the economy and creating jobs for our people.
Overcoming the toughest challenges stemming from the legacy of apartheid means working together with government to implement its programmes, grow the economy and attract more foreign investment.
Eskom.
Cabinet received a report from Deputy President David Mabuza on the work of the joint Special Cabinet Committee on Eskom that was established in response to recent electricity supply disruptions and the negative impact on the economy.
Government’s coordinated efforts to bring financial, operational and structural sustainability to Eskom are proceeding in earnest.
The Special Cabinet Committee is convened by Deputy President Mabuza and includes the Ministers of Public Enterprises, Energy, Transport, Finance, Police and State Security.
It will be required to monitor energy supply on a daily basis.
In line with President Ramaphosa’s commitment that government’s response to the electricity crisis must be inclusive and consultative, the Minister of Public Enterprises and the Eskom board Chairperson had their first preliminary engagements with the leadership of the three labour unions recognized by Eskom, the coal mining industry and the engineering fraternity.
The meeting with labour reported on the problems with Eskom’s operations and generation system, maintenance and unplanned outages.
The meeting sought to establish a basis for formal future consultations.
The restructuring of Eskom was also discussed, and all parties agreed that there would be more interactions to better understand the roadmap and the implications of separating Eskom’s business divisions into three separate operating entities.
The coal mining industry was convened under the auspices of the Minerals Council of South Africa (MINCOSA), and the meeting raised problems related to coal supply, costs and pricing, and the quality of coal provided to Eskom.
Further engagements were convened with the engineering fraternity, under the auspices of the Engineering Council of South Africa (ECSA).
All engineering specialist disciplines were represented by their respective voluntary associations, including the National Association of Black Engineers.
The ECSA gave its analysis of the problems facing Eskom and provided a set of recommendations about how to involve the broader South African academic and technical professional fraternity in the urgent interventions required to stabilize electricity supply.
MINCOSA and the ECSA will assist government to establish a Technical Operations and Maintenance Review Team for Eskom that will be announced shortly.
Renewable energy.
Cabinet supports the announcements by Energy Minister Jeff Radebe, which reaffirms the basic rationale behind renewable energy in arresting the high negative impact of fossil fuel sources of energy such as oil and coal.
Energy is a key enabler in South Africa’s trajectory towards socio- economic growth and development.
The National Development Plan (NDP) states that South Africa needs at least 20 000 megawatts of renewable energy by 2030.
The Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme has made a significant impact on the economy, job creation, community upliftment, economic transformation and climate change.
While South Africa continues to make a significant contribution to the global effort for a low-carbon and climate resilient developments, government remains committed to ensuring a responsible and just transition to a cleaner future.
The World Bank Group recently hosted the South African Renewable Energy and Energy Storage Systems in Cape Town from 25 to 26 February 2019 under the theme: “Batteries, Energy Storage and the Renewable Future – Towards a 100% Dispatchable Renewable Energy System”.
Delegates from industry, finance, utilities, regulators, government and academia discussed advancements in the renewable-energy sector including policy, regulatory, financial, business, technological, applications, innovation, codes and standards issues that are required for the expansion of renewable energy.
Renewable energy and energy storage technologies enable us to convert electrical power into an energy form and store it for later use when needed.
Energy storage systems reduce the need for back-up capacity from coal or gas-fired electrical generation plants, thereby reducing power sector emissions and help us mitigate against climate change.
Special Economic Zones (SEZs) Programme.
Cabinet welcomes local and international investor confidence displayed through investments in the Saldanha Bay Industrial Development Zone (SBIDZ), which is developing into a world-class offshore and martime hub.
This is part of the Department of Trade and Industry’s SEZ Programme.
The establishment of SEZs countrywide is reversing the concentration of economic activity to certain areas of the country as a result of apartheid spatial planning.
Since their establishment, SEZs have contributed to attracting foreign direct investment such as the recently signed a R3-billion investment at the SBIDThe SBIDZ’s investment pipeline includes at least five more investments that will add another R.4 billion of investment to the short and medium-term outlook of the zone, once completed.
Water supply.
Cabinet welcomes the Mzimvubu Water Project’s advanced infrastructure at Esiqhungqwini village in Tsolo, situated in Mhlontlo Local Municipality in the Eastern Cape, as an example of how government continues to meet the needs of communities despite South Africa being a water-stressed country The realisation of such water projects create job opportunities and ensure potable water supply for domestic and industrial use.
Since the advent of democracy much work has been done to ensure that communities have access to basic services like clean water.
Nearly 90% of households currently have access to piped water.
School safety.
Cabinet condemns reported incidents of bullying, robberies and violence in some of the country’s schools.
Our children need safe environments of learning and we call on learners, educators, parents and guardians to work together to protect our children socially, physically and emotionally.
Cabinet also commends the South African Police Service for their swift apprehension of suspects involved in an attempted hijacking at an Edenvale school in Gauteng.
Cabinet makes a special appeal to school governing bodies to assess the existing infrastructure of their schools to ensure that school buildings are safe, regularly maintained and conducive to learning.
Unacceptable practices by some religious leaders.
Cabinet noted with concern recent media reports about certain unacceptable practices by some religious leaders.
The recent purported resurrection of a deceased person is a case in point.
More of such incidences have happened in the recent past, ranging from spraying of congregants with poisonous insecticides to encouraging them to consume vehicle fuel, rats and grass, among others.
People approach religious institutions to gain spiritual fulfilment and psychological strength, especially when they are at their lowest and most vulnerable state.
Cabinet calls on all people to work together to stop these practices which abuse people’s vulnerability and endanger their lives.
The law-enforcement agencies should intervene where acts of criminality have been committed under the guise of religion.
Cabinet has also noted that the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities is investigating these practices, which will provide a more comprehensive intervention that will stop them.
2019 national and provincial elections.
Cabinet calls on all eligible South Africans, especially young first time voters who have registered in their thousands, to exercise their right to vote in the upcoming National and Provincial Elections on Wednesday, 8 May 2019, and have a say in the future of the country.
President Ramaphosa has officially proclaimed and gazetted the 8 May 2019 as the date for the national and provincial elections.
This means the voters’ roll is now officially closed and people will no longer be able to register to vote in the May elections.
The President has also in terms of Section 2A of the Public Holidays Act, 1994 (Act 36 of 1994), as amended, declared 8 May 2019 as a public holiday throughout the country.
In South Africa, the right to vote is a culmination of years of struggle for our freedom.
It came at a huge cost with countless of our country men andwomen sacrificing their lives.
Caster Semenya.
Cabinet joins the rest of South Africa in standing united behind our golden girl Caster Semenya.
Her case, which is being heard before the Court of Arbitration for Sport, is more than just a sporting matter.
It is about fundamental human rights and the inherent dignity of all people.
We call on people to show their support at #HandsOffCaster.
Let us show the world that we are a nation which values fairness, equality and respect for human dignity.
Creative industry.
Cabinet is pleased with the positive outcomes of the Creative Industry interaction led by Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, held under the Theme: “Leveraging on Digital Platforms for Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) Creatives”.
The purpose was to engage the industry to assess the impact of the 4IR on the creative sector, and within the broadcasting and audio-visual sector, and to develop formal stakeholder platforms towards its transformation.
Participants agreed that government should engage stakeholders and Parliament on the Copyright Amendment Bill, development of the Media Transformation Charter, engage broadcasters in an endeavour to curbexploitation of small and independent producers, and ensure that content owners duly benefit from their content being used on online platforms.
Fake social media accounts.
Cabinet notes with concern fake LinkedIn and Facebook accounts which claim to be that of Ministers and Deputy Ministers.
We wish to warn members of the public not to be misled and drawn in by these fake accounts, some of which promise fake business opportunities, and which requests people to pay money to be part of these businessopportunities.
No member of the Executive solicits payments for any official transactions via social media.
In cases of doubt, please contact the various ministries or departments at WEBTOKEMembers of the public are urged to exercise caution and those who fell prey to these impersonators should immediately report it to the police.
Cabinet condemns activities performed in the name of members of the Executive or any other member of society through fake social media accounts.
We distance ourselves from the comments, views and photographs purported by these fake accounts.
Venezuela.
Cabinet is concerned about the unfolding situation in Venezuela, especially the humanitarian challenges that require urgent attention.
We commend efforts by the United Nations (UN) to provide humanitariansupport to locals and call on the the international community to support the people of Venezuela during this difficult time.
Cabinet further supports calls for the people of Venezuela to be afforded the opportunity to decide their own future.
Drawing from our own experience in South Africa, we believe that a permanent solution can only be achieved from internal and inclusive political dialogue involving all affected parties in that country.
