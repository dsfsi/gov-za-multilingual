Issues in the environment.

The National Disaster Management Centre continues to coordinate all spheres of government in its efforts to provide humanitarian relief to all affected households.

Cabinet reminded everyone to continue safeguarding ourselves and other people by washing or sanitising our hands regularly, wearing a mask when indoors, maintaining a safe social distance, opening windows for ventilation and vaccinating.
Vaccination remains the best defence against COVID-19 as it prevents severe illness, hospitalisation and even death.

Stop racism!.
Cabinet strongly condemned all acts of racism in the country, including the reported incidents at the Good Hope Seminary High School and the University of Stellenbosch in the Western Cape.
These deplorable acts go against the constitutional values on which our democratic country was founded, which include human dignity, non-racialism, non-sexism, social justice, equity and respect.
The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996 is our guide towards eradicating the despicable divisions and injustices of the past.
Parents are urged to teach children to reject racism and embrace diversity, as part of our concerted drive to promote nation-building and social cohesion.
Let us work together to expose racism wherever it is treated as the norm and send a clear message that there is no space for it in our democratic country.

Child labour represents the worst of society and exposes children to dangerous situations.
It constitutes abuse and prevents children from getting an education and other developmental opportunities.
Every child in South Africa has the inalienable right to be protected from exploitative labour practices.
The right to basic education is enshrined in our Constitution and in terms of the South African Schools Act, 1996 (Act 84 of 1996), “every parent must cause every learner for whom he or she is responsible to attend a school from the first school day of the year in which such learner reaches the age of seven years until the last school day of the year in which such learner reaches the age of 15 years or the ninth grade, whichever occurs first”.
In terms of the Children’s Act, 2005 (Act 38 of 2005), “no person may use, procure, offer or employ a child for child labour”.Cabinet decisions.

These include the process of transferring communal land from the State to the appropriate rights holders, which is important for the empowerment of rural communities.
