Good Green Deeds.
Cabinet thanks all South Africans who joined President Cyril Ramaphosa in the launch of the national Good Green Deeds campaign.
The campaign, presents an opportunity for the various sectors of society to play their part and become more environmentally conscious.
South Africa is one of the signatories to the Paris Agreement on climate change which guides the international efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
It is the duty and responsibility of all people in South Africa to ensure a clean and healthy environment now and for the future generations.
A well-managed environment will contribute in reducing the greenhouse gas emissions, contribute towards food security, water, energy and general livelihoods.
Cabinet calls on everyone to make the Good Green Deeds campaign a way of living so that our neighborhoods, communities and the country can become a global example of being clean, green and habitable.
Land Claims.
Cabinet is pleased with the continued roll out programme of land reforms that seek to correct the wrongs of the past and build a more equitable society that will benefit all South Africans.
In advancing the equitable distribution of land, President Ramaphosa led the handover of the settled and finalised 142 hectares of prime land claims to the community of Moretele, who indicated that they will use the land for development.
These communities lost their rights to land when they were abruptly removed from their properties following the implementation of the provisions of the Natives Land Act of 1913.
The Commission on Restitution of Land Rights (CRLR) has spent over R203 million in settling and finalising the claims.
Eskom.
Cabinet received a report from Deputy President David Mabuza on the work of the joint Special Cabinet Committee on Eskom that was established in response to recent, electricity supply disruptions and its negative impact on the economy.
Government’s coordinated efforts to bring financial, operational and structural sustainability to Eskom are proceeding in earnest.
The Eskom Technical Review Team appointed by the Minister of Public Enterprises and the Board of Eskom started its work this week.
It is expected to produce a preliminary report within four (4) weeks.
The performance of the power plants remain volatile even though load-shedding has not been implemented since 15 February 2019.There has been a number of major incidents in the distribution areas that have contributed to the power disruptions.
Cabinet noted the good progress that has been made with the recovery of coal stocks across the power stations, but further attention must be given to the Coal Supply Chain.
Cabinet however, remains concerned about the performance of the Medupi and Kusile power stations and has mandated the Minister of Public Enterprises to provide a comprehensive recovery plan based on a reassessment of the key drivers of the cost and time overruns for this new build project.
ILO commission on the future of work and EDCON agreement.
Cabinet welcomes the global commission’s report which made 10 recommendations grouped into three pillars: investing in the capabilities of people, investing in the institutions of the world of work and investing in decent, sustainable work.
The recommendation directly speaks to the triple challenges of inequality, poverty and unemployment.
Through the work of Minister of Labour Mildred Oliphant, South Africa has made progress in improving workplace conditions through gender balanced measures, more transparency in pay, eliminating violence, harassment in the workplace and specific measures to ensure equal opportunities.
Cabinet also, welcomes the joint efforts of government, the Unemployment Insurance Fund (which includes trade unions) and the private sector (banks and shopping mass landlords) to recapitalize South Africa’s largest clothing retailer – EDCOIn order to conclude an agreement to save Edcon, all parties had to make sacrifices and to work closely together.
At the heart of efforts to ensure that Edcon stays afloat is the impact on employment.
More than 40 000 direct jobs and many more thousands of direct and indirect jobs would have been lost if Edcon had not been recapitalized.
Cabinet calls on South Africans to support the call made at the Jobs Summit to buy Proudly South African products and support local industry.
Square Kilometer Array (SKA).
A new era for global science governance was realised when the Minister of Science and Technology, Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane, on behalf of the South African government, signed the international treaty (called the Rome Convention) in Italy, on 12 March 2019.
This establishes the Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO), as an intergovernmental organization, tasked with building and operating the world's most powerful radio astronomy telescope, to be located in South Africa and Australia.
Cabinet congratulates the partner nations on this historic milestone and reaffirms South Africa’s commitment to the SKA project, continuing on the successful launch of our MeerKAT telescope and South Africa’s critical contribution to the SKA telescope design.
The SKA Observatory will be the first international organisation dedicated to science, in which Africa will exercise a strong leadership role, in the science, engineering and policy domains.
KwaZulu-Natal flooding.
Cabinet extends its appreciation for the support from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) which have also joined forces with government in dispatching aid during the recent floods experienced in some parts of the country.
In minimising the impact of the recent flash floods in KwaZulu-Natal, government continues to provide aid and support to affected families.
Disaster teams and officials are assessing the damage.
