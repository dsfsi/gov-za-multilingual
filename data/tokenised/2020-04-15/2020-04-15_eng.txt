Statement on the Special Cabinet Meeting held on Wednesday, 15 April 2020 A virtual Special Cabinet Meeting was held today, 15 April 2020, to discuss the socio-economic recovery plan post the COVID-19 National Lockdown.
This follows the announcement made by President Cyril Ramaphosa two weeks ago, that the Cabinet would have a full discussion to come up with an economic recovery plan for the country.
Five presentations were received from the clusters: (1) Economic Sectors, Investment, Employment and Infrastructure Development (2) Governance, State Capacity and Institutional Development (3) Social Protection, Community and Human Development (4) International Cooperation, Trade and Security and (5) Justice, Crime Prevention and Security.
The presentations were a culmination of the work done by all the Cabinet clusters, focusing on the country’s economic recovery as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent downgrading of South Africa by ratings agencies Moody’s and Fitch respectively.
Cabinet resolved that further discussions and consultations are still required before the final consolidated plan is approved to be shared with the nation.
All the Cabinet clusters have been asked to work together to produce one consolidated document on key priorities of the country’s economic recovery plan, to be completed before the next Cabinet Meeting scheduled to take place on Monday, 20 April 2020.
Cabinet has also directed Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan to prepare an updated report on the South African Airways, for discussion at the upcoming meeting.
Thereafter, Cabinet will finalise the country’s economic recovery plan.
Cabinet thanks all people across the country for staying at home during the lockdown period.
