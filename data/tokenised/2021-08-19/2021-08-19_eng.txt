Cabinet Decision.
National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC).
Cabinet received the report from the NCCC indicating that over nine million vaccines have been administered in South Africa to date, with over seven million people partially vaccinated and over four million fully vaccinated.
Cabinet welcomed the vaccination roll-out plan to increase the uptake of vaccines, particularly in provinces that had shown a reduction in the uptake of vaccines.
As part of increasing the vaccination roll-out programme, Cabinet approved the vaccination of persons aged between 18 years and 35 years from 20 August 2021.
Scientific evidence confirms that vaccinated people stand a better chance of surviving from COVID-19 than unvaccinated people.
Therefore, we must all dispel the unfounded and misleading conspiracy theories about the vaccines and choose life by vaccinating.
Cabinet further approved the keeping of the country under the Risk-Adjusted Alert Level 3 of the national lockdown, as advised by the Ministerial Advisory Committee.
Cabinet encourages all unvaccinated people in South Africa to get vaccinated because vaccines protect us from getting seriously ill from COVID-19 and they save lives.
