Issues in the Environment.
Energy.
Cabinet noted the progress made in the implementation of the Energy Action Plan, while it acknowledges significant constraints that still remain against the national grid.
As the country enters the Winter period, Cabinet welcomed the finalisation of the Contract for 400 megawatts (MW) of additional capacity through the Standard Offer Programme which will be online before the end of May 2023.
Furthermore, the Department of Health has identified 213 hospitals for exclusion from load-shedding, with 76 of these already excluded and work to add another 46 hospitals at an advanced stage.
Cabinet further welcomed the imminent launch of the Energy One-Stop Shop on 31 May 2023 by Invest SA to speed up the regulatory processes that will assist new power-generating companies to come on board.
It has noted progress made at the Kusile Power Station to restore 3 200 MW, through units 1, 2, 3 and 5, to the national grid by the end of 2023.
Cabinet is concerned about the continued circulation of fake news, through social media alleging an imminent national grid collapse that will result in a total blackout.
Eskom has assured government of plans in place for the system safeguards to prevent a national blackout.
Cabinet reiterates calls to all people in South Africa to continue to save electricity.
The target is to save at least 1 000 MW everyday, which equals saving one stage of load-shedding each day.
The Minister of Electricity, Dr Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, will update the country on the implementation of the Energy Action Plan on Friday, 26 May 2023, through a media briefing.
Health.
Government has established a technical working committee, led by the National Department of Health, in response of the outbreak of cholera in Hammanskraal in the City of Tshwane, which has already claimed 15 lives as of 24 May 2023.
Extensive work is underway to test all possible sources of the contamination, be they water sources, tankers delivering water, taps and the Rooiwal Wastewater Treatment Works (WWTW).
To date, no evidence of cholera bacteria has been found in these sources, giving confidence to the likelihood that the cholera outbreak could be from a once-off contamination event, with the current cases being a result of secondary and tertiary contamination.
As these interventions unfold, residents of Hammanskraal are encouraged to boil tap water and add a pinch of salt before drinking it.
In addition, anyone with a runny tummy, nausea or gastrointestinal symptoms must immediately visit their doctor or local clinic.
The Minister of Water and Sanitation, Mr Senzo Mchunu, will meet with the City of Tshwane Mayor, Cllr Cilliers Brink, on Friday 26 May 2023 in an effort to develop a joint plan for the long overdue refurbishment of the Rooiwal WWTFor more information you can call the 24-hour hotline of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) on 082 883 9920.
Cholera treatment guidelines are online at WEBTOKEQuarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS).
Cabinet is encouraged that the 2023 first QLFS has indicated a sixth consecutive quarterly increase on the number of jobs and that the employment of million people is inching closer to the million employed people in pre-Coronavirus (COVID)-19 days.
This is a clear indication that the South African economy is firmly recovering from the impact of that pandemic.
The first quarter employment figures show 209 000 jobs were created in the formal sector and 107 000 jobs in the informal sector during the first quarter of the year.
South Africa – United States (US) relations Cabinet affirmed that relations between South Africa and the US remain cordial, strong and mutually beneficial following a meeting between the Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Dr Naledi Pandor and US Ambassador to South Africa, Mr Reuben E Brigety, over his remarks alleging that South Africa supplied weapons to Russia.
Cabinet reiterated that established diplomatic channels are available to all nations, including the US, to raise issues as they arise in the management of the bilateral relations.
Cabinet welcomed the announcement by President Cyril Ramaphosa of the establishment of an independent inquiry to probe the allegations of the supply of weapons from South Africa to Russia.
Details of the inquiry will be announced in due course.

Water infrastructure.
President Ramaphosa visited the Lesotho Highlands Water Project on Tuesday, 23 May 2023 during which he participated in the sod-turning ceremony of Phase 2 of the project.
Signed a number of years back and having faced delays, this ceremony signified the pacing up of this critical binational initiative.
The Lesotho Highlands Water Project is critical in ensuring security of water supply in Gauteng, the Free State, Mpumalanga, North West and Northern Cape.
The investment in water infrastructure to uplift the lives of South Africans continues with the allocation of over R14 billion to municipalities to address water infrastructure backlogs, through the Regional Bulk Infrastructure Grant (RBIG) and the Water Services Infrastructure Grant (WSIG).
The RBIG will be spent on 130 projects and the WSIG will be allocated to over 400 projects across the country.
Cabinet is also pleased that the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) is making strides in the fight against corruption with nearly R600 million repaid by companies who benefited from receiving irregular tenders.
Cabinet also noted the preventative control measures put in place by the department to eliminate irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure.
Social Security Award.
